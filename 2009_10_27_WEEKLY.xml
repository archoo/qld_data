Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.35 am): For the past four weeks, firefighters throughout Queensland have been battling the most intense and widespread blazes that our state has ever seen. Officers from our Fire and Rescue Service, our Rural Fire Service and from the New South Wales Rural Fire Service have stood side by side protecting the homes and properties of hundreds of Queenslanders. More than three-quarters of these people were volunteers and their efforts have contained more than an extraordinary 4,200 fires. It has been a mammoth effort, and it is not over yet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999633"></A>
The conditions for the start of this fire season have been some of the most challenging in decades. With more hot, dry weather forecast, our firefighters are in for a long and dangerous summer. While firefighters have been battling walls of fire across the state, great stories of great heroism have emerged. Residents whom I spoke to during my visit to Rockhampton last week told me about neighbours who helped them protect their homes, about firefighters who went above and beyond the call of duty to save entire streets from burning to the ground and about the remarkable talent of the pilots whose precision water bombing stopped fires from spreading into suburbs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001580"></A>
Walking through the streets of Norman Gardens and Lakes Creek in Rockhampton with the member for Rockhampton and the member for Keppel, I could see just how close the fires came to the fences of people’s homes. It is an absolute credit to our fire service that only two homes were lost. I am sure I speak for all members when I say that our thoughts and prayers are with the family of 73-year-old Rodney Dubignon, who suffered a heart attack while helping protect his property at Greenbank, and also with the Rockhampton family whose home could not be saved from the blaze. There is no doubt that it will take a long time for this family to rebuild their lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001583"></A>
Indeed, for landholders whose properties have been affected, whose crops have been destroyed and whose livestock has been left without feed and fencing, the recovery effort is going to be enormous. But the Queensland government will be working with affected communities to help them rebuild. Together with the federal government, we have activated disaster relief funding arrangements for a number of local government areas, providing opportunities for people to apply for assistance. At Gaeta, north of Bundaberg, the state government is working with the Bundaberg Regional Council to help this rural community recover. We have sent in three, four-person RoadTek crews to help repair damaged fences, with 20 students from the Agricultural College also providing support on the ground. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999981"></A>
As is the case in all major disaster response efforts, the government will sit down with fire authorities to look at the response and determine any areas where improvements can be made. But today I want to say thank you--a huge thank you--to the firefighters, to logistics officers who support them, to all of the support staff who are supporting the individuals and their equipment, and to the communities who came together and worked tirelessly for the past month to protect the homes, the lives and the property of their fellow Queenslanders. The efforts of these individuals is the essence of Queensland’s community spirit and all Queenslanders are very proud of what they have achieved. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.38 am): As honourable members are aware, I recently led a trade mission to India, the United Arab Emirates and Russia--important export markets for Queensland. India is now Queensland’s second largest export destination for this state, with merchandise exports totalling more than $6.6 billion in 2008-09 and we saw an astonishing growth of almost 130 per cent over the previous year. India is growing exponentially and our benefits from that growth are also exponential. India was also Queensland’s largest export destination of knowledge intensive exports, with a value of $472 million. While in India, I took the opportunity to meet with major education agents and to reiterate to them that Queensland is a safe destination for Indian students. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003716"></A>
Apart from trade matters, while in India I met with Commonwealth Games officials to promote Queensland as a potential host for future Commonwealth Games. The United Arab Emirates is Queensland’s largest merchandise export market in the Middle East--again, a growing market--taking 70 per cent of Queensland’s merchandise exports to the region. In 2008-09, these exports were valued at more than $280 million.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003719"></A>
Queensland was the first Australian state to establish trade representation in Abu Dhabi, opening an office there in February 2007. During my visit earlier this month I opened a new Trade Queensland office in Abu Dhabi. During this visit I was also pleased to announce that next month Tourism Queensland will appoint a representative in the Middle East to grow Queensland as a holiday destination. The Gold Coast is a significant holiday destination for people from the UAE and we want to make sure we grow that market.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003720"></A>
The Queensland government is also the most active Australian state in leading the development of government, business and cultural ties with Russia. Total merchandise exports to Russia from Queensland were valued at more than $570 million in the last financial year, and Queensland makes up two-thirds of all Australian merchandise exports to Russia. Already there are a number of major Queensland companies successfully exporting to Russia, particularly in the agribusiness, mining technologies and services, and education and training sectors.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003721"></A>
In the wake of Russia’s recent ban on imports of Australia’s kangaroo products, I met with the Acting Minister for Agriculture, Oleg Aldoshin, to help boost Russia’s confidence in, and demand for, Queensland meat products. These negotiations were an important first step towards the resumption of this important export. Reports of subsequent negotiations at officer level in Moscow have been overwhelmingly positive, with the Russian government confirming that the ball is now in our court and that it will move to lift the ban when Australia can confirm that all standards can now be met. The process to achieve this is being accelerated by Queensland Primary Industries and Fisheries in partnership with the industry. I want to again acknowledge the contribution of the member for Gregory in that effort. This trade mission, especially in challenging times for businesses, is about growing Queensland’s economy, growing our capacity for exports and growing jobs in a number of sectors. That is what this government is all about. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.42 am): Today I am honoured to be taking part in the annual launch of the Smith Family appeal. Last year my government doubled its contribution from the usual $50,000 to $100,000. This was in recognition of the outstanding work that this charity does in making sure that every Queensland family has a Christmas to remember. In these difficult economic times, that support has been particularly important. That is why this year my government will once again contribute $100,000 to the Smith Family annual campaign. Last Christmas this charity provided more than 1,800 Christmas hampers to disadvantaged families and distributed 6,300 toy and gift packs to children across Queensland. But the Smith Family also provides priceless education programs that can help our young people lift themselves out of the poverty and disadvantage that they endure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003727"></A>
Today I am pleased to announce further that our government will contribute $500,000 of new funding towards Indigenous literacy programs for Far North Queensland Indigenous communities in partnership with the Smith Family. The Smith Family’s childhood literacy program Let’s Read will use this funding to extend its services across the cape and the Torres Strait, delivering this program to 14 communities in total. I encourage all Queenslanders, especially those in this House, to recognise those who will do it tough this Christmas and give generously to the Smith Family appeal. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.43 am): On a final and somewhat sad note, I want to say a few words about the death of Lance Corporal Mason Kerrin Edwards. I think we all agree that serving Australia in a time of war is one of the most important duties that a person can undertake, and those who lose their lives in this effort have provided a service of the most supreme sacrifice.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003735"></A>
Today I would like to take this opportunity to convey the condolences of all Queenslanders to the family and friends of Lance Corporal Mason Kerrin Edwards, who was tragically killed in a training accident in South Australia last week. Although Lance Corporal Edwards was born in England in 1979, he spent most of his young life in Queensland attending Kelvin Grove State High School. He enlisted in the Australian Army in 2004 after graduating from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology. Prior to his enlistment, he served as a pilot officer in the Australian Air Force Cadets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003737"></A>
Lance Corporal Edwards was a distinguished soldier who was held in the highest regard by his peers. He proudly served his country in East Timor in 2006, in Afghanistan in 2007 and again in Afghanistan in 2008. It was while he was training with the Australian Army’s 2nd Commando Regiment for his third deployment in Afghanistan that he tragically lost his life. This is a poignant reminder to all of us of the constant dangers faced by the men and women of the Australian Defence Forces both at home and abroad. On behalf of all Queenslanders and all members of this House, I convey our deepest condolences to the family and our warm wishes in memory of Lance Corporal Edwards. <Hansard-Speech-End>

This agreement is an important step on the path to our plans to strengthen our finances, create a stronger Queensland economy and a stronger Queensland future. We as a government are committed to dealing fairly with affected workers and their representative unions above all else, and we are committed to gaining value for the taxpayer. The FPQ agreement will see 400 workers’ jobs guaranteed for three years after the date of sale and has been negotiated with the AWU and QCU unions, including the CFMEU, the QPSU and the AMWU.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003743"></A>
I want to explicitly acknowledge that there is continued opposition to our decision to put FPQ to the market but equally acknowledge its work in securing an agreement on these critical issues in such a timely manner. The agreement provides that all current enterprise bargaining agreement terms and conditions transfer with the employees to the new entity; employees will retain all existing accrued entitlements, such as holiday and sick leave; employees can maintain their existing superannuation arrangements, including for those who currently hold the defined benefit account; and there will be no forced relocations for 12 months after the sale, with any proposed relocations conducted in consultation with employees and their unions. These undertakings are important. They reflect our enduring commitment to working with the union movement despite our policy differences on this matter. The interests of workers and their families remain our enduring shared priority, and this agreement reflects as much.</Hansard-Body>

Another key milestone last week underlined the importance of the asset sales program. At approximately 4.45 am last Tuesday, Queensland’s population reached 4,444,444. Such is the speed of population growth in this state, we have already welcomed an additional 2,000 people in the week gone by, as we do every week. I was fortunate enough to meet our newest Queenslander, Harry Milner, and his mum, Elizabeth, at the Royal Brisbane Women’s Hospital that day. I can inform the House that, as expected, little Harry was blissfully unaware of the importance of the milestone, but I am sure mum and dad will remind him of it in future years and his 21st birthday DVD already has its first shots.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003747"></A>
This population milestone was important for two reasons. It embodies the fortunate position Queensland is in to have an economy that can build on the back of this growth, and it underlines the infrastructure and service delivery task we face now and into the future. We have moved to restructure our finances to ensure we can build the schools, roads and hospitals that Harry Milner and his generation will need. We need to make choices. We cannot keep funding ports and rail lines that advantage mining companies while we welcome more than 100,000 new Queenslanders each and every year. As our population grows, we have the plans in place to cater for that growth. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (9.48 am): The domestic building industry is at last showing some positive signs of recovery. These signs are occurring right across the state and are closely linked to the record $18.2 billion infrastructure spend by the Bligh government. We are supporting the jobs of Queensland workers, not cutting them back. This is fact and not myth, and the signs are that slowly but surely things are getting better.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003751"></A>
For proof of these positive signs, we need look no further than the Queensland Building Services Authority annual report, which I tabled last Wednesday. Since March, the number of insurance policies under the home warranty insurance scheme for renovations and new house construction has steadily increased. This is supported by 8,463 insurance policies written in September--up 11 per cent--from 7,589 in August. However, when things do not go right in the building process, consumers are thankful that in Queensland we run the best home warranty insurance scheme in the country and, in my view, in the world.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003787"></A>
Since 1 July the scheme has been further enhanced with the introduction of additional insurance coverage to include the period between a builder becoming insolvent and the appointment of another builder to finish the job. I thank the member for Mermaid Beach, Mr Stevens, for his input into that. This period can sometimes take months. Previously the project was uninsured during this time and any building material removed or vandalism that occurred was not covered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003791"></A>
According to the report, 98.8 per cent of valid insurance claims were paid during the 2008-09 financial year. The report shows licence renewal fees in Queensland are the second lowest in Australia. For the record, Victoria is the only state with a licence fee lower than ours but its licensees must pay a fee for each additional licence. Queensland has one fee regardless of the number of different licences held. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003792"></A>
To further assist contractors working hard to return to prosperity, the BSA has conducted 20 Building Better Business educational shows, 21 regional contractor education seminars and 50 trade-specific seminars throughout the state. The BSA is doing its best to help builders and contractors while at the same time protecting consumers. The domestic building industry is critical to this state’s success and the Bligh government is moving heaven and earth to ensure its recovery. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.50 am): Queensland’s export industry is a key driver in supporting our state through the global financial crisis. The Bligh government recognises the importance of exporting and has been proactive in providing business assistance. This government has delivered low levels of payroll tax along with apprentice and trainee rebates for employers. Our export results are outstanding. With only 21 per cent of Australia’s population, we contribute 33 per cent of our nation’s exports. Queensland has become the second highest exporter of all states in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003798"></A>
Through strong support for exporting we are delivering the jobs that we need for Queenslanders. Our state’s export awards program last week celebrated its 20th year of recognising the achievements and capabilities of Queensland’s export businesses. The awards provided our outstanding exporters due recognition and reward. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003799"></A>
Queensland is in a very strong position and we need to push forward and look to new opportunities. Export Week achieves that goal. Preliminary figures from last week’s events estimate around 2,000 people attended 45 export functions or information and networking sessions. With Queensland’s 10 trade commissioners hosting many of these events, the strong interest--and early indications point to it being significantly up on last year--demonstrates strong business confidence in our economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003800"></A>
I can confidently report that Queensland has a number of very impressive exporters delivering a range of products and services to global markets. Take, for example, NOJA Power Switchgear--Queensland’s Exporter of the Year. It was only a couple of years ago that NOJA was Queensland’s emerging exporter of the year. It then went on to win Queensland’s Small Exporter of the Year. It picked up the award recently as Queensland’s Large Exporter of the Year and now Queensland’s Exporter of the Year. It is a fantastic story. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003803"></A>
The state’s strong merchandise exporting results speak for themselves, with 20 per cent growth in 2008-09 to a value of $56.3 billion. The fundamentals are in place. Our major trading partners are forecast to grow by over three per cent next year. We will regain the momentum that has put us ahead of the pack. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003804"></A>
I would like to thank all nominees for their great contribution to Queensland exporting. The Bligh government will continue its support, which last financial year delivered more than $500 million of export outcomes, helping more than 2,000 clients on the pathway to exporting success. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Public consultation will run for six months across Queensland, and the discussion paper will be translated into different languages to ensure as many people as possible get a chance to have their say. We need to look for new ways to promote cultural diversity and further strengthen Queensland communities. Our diverse communities make an enormous contribution to the cultural and economic life of the state. </Hansard-Body>

Earlier this month over 50,000 people enjoyed international music, cuisine and live performances at the Queensland Multicultural Festival in Brisbane, in a celebration of the state’s diversity. I have also attended a number of other successful multicultural festivals across Queensland this year, including the Australian-Italian Festival in Ingham--in the member for Hinchinbrook’s electorate--the Bundaberg Multicultural Festival and the Gold Coast Multicultural Festival.</Hansard-Body>

Our skilled migrant intake is helping to power the Queensland economy, with more than 3,600 arrivals in 2008-09. The Bligh government recognises the benefits that migration and multiculturalism bring to Queensland. Queenslanders have embraced multiculturalism and we are encouraging them to come up with new ideas to help build a stronger multicultural future for all of us. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (9.55 am): I am pleased to inform the House that doctors in Queensland’s public hospitals have voted to accept a $354 million pay deal from the state government. Late yesterday the result of the ballot indicated that 60 per cent of Queensland’s salaried doctors had voted in support of the proposed new certified agreement. That is the one that the opposition was criticising. This is an increase in support from the last certified agreement back in 2005. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003820"></A>
Queensland Health will now seek formal certification of the agreement by the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission. The new Medical Officers (Queensland Health) Certified Agreement (No. 2) 2009, otherwise know as MOCA2, will provide salaried doctors employed by Queensland Health with a package of wages and conditions that is extremely competitive with public sector doctors in other states and territories. The wages component will deliver a 12.5 per cent pay rise over three years to almost 5,500 medical officers employed by Queensland Health. This will be back paid to 1 June 2009.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003822"></A>
The certified agreement will also see significant advancements in fatigue management, building on the government’s ongoing strategies to improve safety for doctors and patients. The agreement, which I will table when it is certified, provides for the framework for reducing the number of maximum hours of work to 12 hours over the life of the agreement and appropriate fatigue breaks for all salaried medical officers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003823"></A>
This framework provides the basis for resident medical officers to work a maximum of 14 hours after the first 12 months down to 12 hours after 24 months. As well, it provides for 10 hours off duty or a fatigue break before being required to be on duty again. For senior medical officers this will also mean the implementation of a 10-hour break. More detail is in the agreement itself. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003824"></A>
I realise there may be exceptional circumstances that arise from time to time but I have made it clear that I expect Queensland Health to work assiduously to meet its obligations in the area of fatigue and shift length. This rostering needs to be implemented gradually to ensure our junior doctors have the appropriate supervision and access to training they need. It also means that there will be sufficient staffing levels to ensure patient care and services are not compromised while the new rosters are introduced. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003825"></A>
I thank the AMAQ for their vocal support of this gradual introduction of revised shift arrangements for these reasons. The government takes the issue of fatigue very seriously. That is why since 2007 we have been implementing a $4.6 million Medical Fatigue Risk Management strategy that was developed in conjunction with and was supported by the QPSU, the SDQ and the AMAQ.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003827"></A>
These strategies include: roster review using fatigue modelling software to analyse rosters to help hospitals identify potential fatigue hot spots in their rosters; rest facilities for staff who are on evening and night shifts or when they are on call; and implementation of a night nurse coordinator role to better facilitate a multidisciplinary handover between evening and night medical staff and to coordinate, allocate and prioritise requests for medical staff assistance during the night shift. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003828"></A>
We also know that tackling fatigue means employing more doctors. Since 2005, and the last agreement, we have employed more than 2,100 extra doctors--that is a 46 per cent increase in the number of doctors treating sick Queenslanders. Moreover, by 2011 Queensland will have nearly tripled the number of medical graduates to 644, compared to just 250 in 2005. This includes a commitment to providing an intern place for all state domestic medical graduates to ensure Queensland trained doctors can continue to work in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003829"></A>
The Bligh government is committed to meeting the challenges of building a strong health workforce for the future. I thank the QPSU, AMAQ and SDQ for endorsing this agreement and encouraging, in the case of the QPSU and the AMAQ, their members to vote yes. Yesterday’s agreement is another step towards building a stronger health system. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PG REEVES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (9.59 am): I am pleased to be able to advise the House--in case some members missed it--that the Nikon SuperGP, staged from Thursday, 22 October to Sunday, 25 October, was a fantastic event for motorsport fans, the Gold Coast economy, local jobs and for Queensland tourism generally. I extend my congratulations not just to the winners of the feature V8 Supercar events but to all of the competitors, support crews, wonderful volunteers and spectators who made this such an outstanding four days of motorsport.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003867"></A>
The race card included the popular top 10 shoot-out and four 150-kilometre V8 Supercar races, second in distance only to the legendary Bathurst 1000. Crowds were also entertained by support categories, including the Pirtek Australian Legends--an event only possible thanks to the generosity of that great Queensland family, the Bowden family, from the Sunshine Coast. Fans voted with their feet in supporting this great Gold Coast event, with more than 205,000 people attending over the four days. TV ratings also proved that this event was a hit with racing fans, with 2.15 million people in the five major Australian metropolitan markets watching all or part of the event’s two-day coverage. The average audience on Sunday--the feature day--was up seven per cent compared to last year. In 2008, on average 537,000 people watched Sunday’s racing compared to 577,000 this year. That is tourism exposure for Queensland that we cannot put a dollar value on.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003871"></A>
While the A1GP let down the Gold Coast community and the Australian motor racing fraternity, it is time now to look closely at the future of this event via two reviews. A review headed by David Williams will analyse the event and provide recommendations for the future. The Auditor-General will conduct his regular yearly review whilst also looking at the contractual agreements with A1GP. I look forward to the findings and ensuring that next year’s event, in its 20th year, is another great success. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Queensland Bushfires</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.01 am): I join with the Premier in paying tribute to the men and women of the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service’s urban, auxiliary and rural brigades for their efforts in protecting life and property during what has been one of the most intensive bushfire seasons in the state’s history. Like the Premier, I saw firsthand just how close the fires came to claiming hundreds of homes adjacent to the Mount Archer National Park in Rockhampton. Sadly, a property was lost in Rockhampton but hundreds were saved.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003877"></A>
The success of our firefighters was not limited to Rockhampton. Across the state, grass and bushfires threatened communities and, thankfully, lives and homes were saved due to the magnificent efforts of our volunteer and permanent firefighters and the many workers and agencies who supported them, including personnel from New South Wales. On behalf of the people of Queensland, I thank them sincerely for their dedication and commitment to protecting life and property.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003878"></A>
What is disappointing, however, is the fact that after weeks of fighting fires our firefighters had to battle another front in the form of an ill-informed attack from the National Party. In what can only be described as an exercise in cheap political point-scoring, the National Party, led by its shadow emergency services minister, launched an attack on firefighters, claiming a lack of planning had put lives and homes at risk from bushfires. The Queensland Fire and Rescue Service has worked closely with Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service in the lead-up to this year’s fire season, as it has done in previous years.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003883"></A>
The Bligh government relies on the advice of experienced operational professionals on the ground on this matter. The advice that those professionals provided to me is that as much prescribed burning as was possible was undertaken this year prior to the bushfire season. For the LNP to claim otherwise is an insult to these senior officers and yet another example of the opposition’s efforts to constantly undermine public confidence in our emergency service agencies.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (10.04 am): The Bligh government is committed to building a world-class public transport network for South-East Queensland. Earlier this month the Deputy Premier and I announced that South-East Queensland would move towards a paperless ticketing system as part of the state government’s five-year fares and products strategy. Under this strategy, the TransLink network will be powered entirely by go card by the end of 2010.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003894"></A>
Increased go card use means faster boarding times, better on-time performance and more data to tailor the rollout of new services. Under the strategy, we also announced that TransLink would issue 400,000 free go cards loaded with $10 credit; introduce off-peak go card discounts of 10 per cent, rising to 20 per cent by 2012; double the retail network for go card purchases; expand the number of ticketing machines at major busway stations and interchanges; roll out a Seniors Card that will double as a go card; and introduce a limited-life go card for occasional users.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003895"></A>
We also announced a new fare structure to balance the funding provided by Queensland taxpayers and fares paid by public transport users. There is never a good time to increase fares but it is reasonable and responsible that a government recovers more than 25 per cent of the true cost of providing public transport. Increasing this cost recovery to 30 per cent over a five-year period will help add capacity for more than 301,000 passengers a week by July next year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003896"></A>
In just over 18 months since the rollout of the go card, we have issued almost 460,000 go cards, had more than $125 million loaded on to them and had more than 51 million trips taken. Melbourne and Sydney authorities are still trying to emulate the success of our go card system, which records more than 1.25 million trips a week across the TransLink network. We have laid strong foundations. With a massive infrastructure program building busways and rail lines, a leading-edge ticketing system that has been successfully rolled out and a sustainable fare path going forward, we are now ready to take the next step and become the world-class system that South-East Queensland is ready for.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. SJ HINCHLIFFE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (10.07 am): I wish to praise the good work of the Queensland Coordinator-General and the Department of Infrastructure and Planning for delivering world-class services to facilitate extensive projects for the benefit of all Queenslanders. In the last financial year alone, the Coordinator-General declared 13 projects worth an estimated $65.2 billion and 27,215 jobs as significant. In 2007-08, 17 projects with an estimated worth of $21.425 billion and 26,359 jobs were also declared. This financial year to date, there have been four significant project declarations worth $8.39 billion and 9,400 jobs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003902"></A>
Yet the stringent evaluation process and the number of projects awaiting assessment were recently the subject of media comment. A recent media report stated that almost 40 projects were tied up in red tape. I would like to clarify the status of those projects. Of the 37 major projects listed as pending in the media reports, 17 are in the process of undertaking an environmental impact statement for which the proponent must supply the necessary information in its own time and 11 have had Coordinator-General reports completed. That means that the process is complete. Four have not applied for significant project declaration, two have been declared significant projects and are awaiting information from the applicants, two were withdrawn by the proponent before completing an environmental impact statement and one project was put on hold at the proponent’s request.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006151"></A>
Of the 17 projects with an EIS underway, just three are awaiting action by the Coordinator-General. A further 14 require action by the proponent. In addition, some of the projects reported by the media as pending have actually been approved. Others are even under construction. These include Rio Tinto’s Clermont coalmine, the Boyne Island aluminium smelter, Xstrata’s Rolleston coalmine, which is now operating, and the Darling Downs power station. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006154"></A>
The time taken to complete stringent environmental assessments has also been subject to media scrutiny. Queenslanders do not want to return to the days of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s when projects were approved without proper environmental assessments. I am happy to say that the Coordinator-General’s process streamlines major project assessment. It is a comprehensive assessment that delivers a streamlined set of conditions for project approvals. Significant projects always have various potential major impacts that need to be thoroughly assessed. These include everything from endangered species through to general environmental impacts such as noise, air or water quality. It takes time to ensure a good sound decision is made. Through the intensive work of the Coordinator-General, in both protecting and progressing the state, Queensland continues to see industrial and economic investment on a global scale. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. CA WALLACE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads) (10.10 am): In 1997-98, the last year the National Party was in government, it delivered a roads program comparatively valued at less than $700 million, which included $196 million in special funding for the Pacific Motorway.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006158"></A>
This financial year we will deliver a program valued at more than five times this level: a record $3.53 billion road infrastructure program. The Bligh government’s 2009-10 Roads Implementation Program is acting to reduce congestion in South-East Queensland and is providing vital infrastructure and links in regional Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006159"></A>
The 2009-10 to 2013-14 Roads Implementation Program, valued at over $18 billion, will on average provide sustainable employment for more than 30,000 Queenslanders every year in roads and supporting industries over the life of the program. There can be no refuting that this government is delivering more road infrastructure each year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006160"></A>
Since 2004-05 investment in roads has grown by 335 per cent, significantly in excess of combined population and construction cost indices, demonstrating the commitment we have made to developing Queensland’s roads. The Bligh government is committed to maintaining its record building program to sustain employment in all parts of the state and to deliver the infrastructure needed to connect Queenslanders. From Cape York to the border we are delivering better roads. That is why we have taken the tough decisions to support our building program and protect jobs for Queenslanders during this economic crisis. We are focused on plans to lead ourselves out of this financial crisis--unlike the National Party, whose only plan was to slash government spending by three per cent, cut jobs and destroy our record building program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006161"></A>
A three per cent cut to the Main Roads budget would represent a $96 million reduction in our record roads budget at a cost of at least 800 jobs across the state. What projects would those National Party members opposite like us to cut or delay to meet its productivity dividend? The Houghton Highway Bridge duplication? The realignment of the Dawson Highway at the Calliope Range? The upgrade of the Kennedy Development Road between Three Ways and The Lynd? These are all vital projects for the people of Queensland and would have a devastating effect on our economy if they were stopped. We have a commitment on this side of the House to jobs, not job cuts. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.13 am): An eminent Aboriginal elder and inspirational leader of the Wik and Wik Waya people of Aurukun, Alison Woolla, sadly passed away on 7 October 2009. Mrs Woolla was born on 5 August 1948 on her traditional lands of Kendall River, south of Aurukun. Educated by Presbyterian missionaries in the community, Alison nevertheless grew up and maintained strong cultural and traditional links to these lands and her people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006167"></A>
Alison was a driving force in her community. She was elected mayor of Aurukun Shire Council on two occasions, becoming the first and only woman to serve in the role, and also serving a term as a councillor. In fact, as mayor in 1991, with a majority team of women councillors, the council moved to close Aurukun’s wet canteen, so concerned were they about the dire impact alcohol was having on the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006168"></A>
Her good friend and mentee, the member for Cook, Jason O’Brien, introduced me to Alison recently. I know how much he admired and respected her and I know he will long feel her passing. Alison was always at the forefront of Indigenous issues in Cape York--indeed in Australia--being one of three primary signatories in the fight for Indigenous land rights for the Wik and Wik Waya people. It was significant that the Federal Court handed down its determination in July this year and that Alison Woolla was present.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006169"></A>
As a strong advocate for the rights of women, children and the elderly, Mrs Woolla was an esteemed member of Queensland’s Ministerial Advisory Council for Domestic and Family Violence for many years. She was the driving force behind establishing Aurukun’s women’s shelter. Alison was always passionate about the need for development within her community without compromising culture or traditions and she instilled these ideals into others, including her children and extended family who were always around her.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006170"></A>
The unique strength and leadership that this outstanding woman has shown throughout her lifetime, and the respect in which she was held, is evident in the enormous progress that is being made in Aurukun today, where her daughter, Keri, has very ably represented Alison in negotiations surrounding the Indigenous Land Use Agreement.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006171"></A>
Alison tragically lost two sons in the 1994 plane crash at Weipa airport. She is survived today by daughters Keri, Amanda and Rhonda and son Christopher Jnr, 10 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006172"></A>
Alison Woolla’s passing was a truly sad day for Aurukun and for Queensland. I am confident that Mrs Woolla’s vision for her people to realise a better quality of life whilst celebrating and maintaining traditional cultures and values will be realised. We as Queenslanders should pay homage to the life and ideals of one of our truly inspirational Indigenous leaders. Rest in peace, Alison, you will be long and well remembered. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (10.16 am): The Bligh government is delivering on its commitment to keep building Queensland. Building new schools in growth areas is part of our $18 billion infrastructure program which is protecting 127,000 Queensland jobs. It is also part of our plan to meet the needs of Queensland’s fast growing population. We are delivering new schools in places where they are most needed: high growth hot spots such as Peregian Springs on the Sunshine Coast. More than 180 students have already enrolled at the new school which will open at the start of next year. Construction is ahead of schedule on the 6.2 hectare site, with all buildings in place and work starting on internal finishes. By the time stage 2 is complete in 2012 the school will cater for about 775 students. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006176"></A>
The Bligh government is working closely with the private sector to deliver this social infrastructure. Peregian Springs State School is one of seven new schools being delivered and maintained as part of the $1.1 billion South-East Queensland public-private partnership project. All schools under this project will be state-of-the-art, four-star, green-star rated facilities. We are delivering the services Queenslanders need using innovative and practical solutions.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1006177"></A>
Re-evaluation and restructure has been part of the impact of the global financial crisis. We have all had to make some tough choices to make sure that we are getting what we need. Governments are no different. We have made tough choices to ensure that we can keep funding our record building program and keep Queenslanders in jobs. We also need to continue delivering vital infrastructure. When the new school at Peregian Springs opens its doors to the first students in January next year it will be because the government made a conscious decision to keep the building program going. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (10.18 am): I know I speak on behalf of everyone in Queensland’s legal, business, sporting and racing communities when I say that the recent passing of Leo Williams is a major loss to our state. Leo’s association with Queensland and Australian business and sport was as significant as it was long. He was not just one of Queensland’s leading solicitors but one of sport’s best administrators.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1007991"></A>
Leo represented Queensland at the highest level in three sports--rugby, swimming and water polo--and was pivotal in the success of many Queensland sporting teams. He was the chairman of the QRU during the Reds’ golden years--some time ago now. He was also chairman of the ARU at the high point of Australian rugby in the early nineties. He then took over as chairman of the Rugby World Cup. One of the things that not many people know is that he relocated the head office of the Rugby World Cup to Dublin, and that saved that organisation many tens of millions of dollars. It was one of his proudest moments when he stood side by side with the Queen and handed John Eales the William Webb Ellis Trophy in 1999 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.</Hansard-Body>

In business he served as a company director for more than 25 companies across a range of industries including resources, sport, construction, media and hospitality. He also served as president of Tattersall’s Club for several years, helping to build it into the strong and profitable club it is today. It was also his service to law, the community and sport that saw him awarded an Order of Australia in 1999.</Hansard-Body>

Leo’s contribution and involvement in Queensland horseracing will also be sadly missed. He really loved the horse racing industry and was heavily involved as a member of several racing clubs and owned several well-performing and many slow horses. His contribution to the industry was not only as a club member and horse owner but also as chairman of the Racing Appeals Tribunal for many years. I served with Leo on that tribunal for eight years. He was always a pleasure to work with. He will be remembered for his fairness and sympathy to the battlers who appeared before him. Above all, Leo was a great family man and a good friend. Our thoughts today are with his wife, Nancye, and children, Nicole, Paul, Anthony and Julienne, at this sad time.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Social Housing</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. KL STRUTHERS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Algester--ALP) (Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women) (10.21 am): The Bligh government is changing the face of social housing right across Queensland. We are rolling out more than 4,000 new social housing dwellings and we are sprucing up a whole lot more. More often than not, our social housing is the best looking housing in the street. We are also rolling out motel makeovers. We have bought a swag of old motels and we are giving them a makeover. It makes sense. It is cheaper and quicker than building from scratch.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008016"></A>
We have transformed the old Rum City Motel in Bundy; we have given it a motel makeover. Last week I also opened new studio units on the Sunshine Coast. The old Sun Surf Motel in Maroochydore has had a motel makeover, too. Tenants are thrilled to bits with their new homes. Take Mark; he showed me around his new apartment in Maroochydore. He had paintings done by his kids on every bit of space on the walls. Mark is not his real name, but the old Sun Surf Motel is now his real home. There are similar stories everywhere I go: humble people whose homes are their pride and joy who cannot wait to show me where they live.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008020"></A>
We have done motel makeovers at the Digger’s Rest in Maryborough, the Hilltop Motel in Gympie, the old Sugar City Motel in Mackay--who has spent a night there--and the Blue Anchor Motel in Yeppoon. They have all been done up to the nines. We are throwing everything we can at this to help the homeless and people who are doing it tough. Not only that, we are kick-starting local economies. We are giving building workers jobs and job security. It does not get much better than that. Not only have we had motel makeovers; we have bought up caravan parks, too--the Lazy Acres Caravan Park and the Woombye caravan park are on our list.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008024"></A>
There are exciting times ahead for social housing in Queensland and there is a lot more work to be done. We know that a number of people are doing it tough right now and we are doing everything we can to give them a helping hand. That is what good governments do. That is what Labor governments do. The Bligh government looks after the battler, unlike the opposition. Imagine the impact of the opposition’s planned three per cent efficiency dividend on the Communities budget. Imagine the impact of its efficiency dividend on the budget of Communities--275 front-line staff, gone; the housing budget, $22 million, gone; 70 social housing units gone; and hundreds of construction jobs gone. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (10.23 am): Our Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service rangers have worked extremely hard during the past month fighting fires in and around our parks and forests, particularly in Central Queensland. This fire season has been the most severe that the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service has experienced in five years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008030"></A>
In preparing for this year’s fire season, since March this year we have carried out over 500 controlled burns covering an area of 780,000 hectares. A high level of cooperation exists between the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service, the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service, rural fire brigade volunteers, other state agencies and local governments to ensure adequate responses are mounted to fire threats. This level of cooperation is a credit to all involved.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008032"></A>
Our rangers alone have responded to more than 270 wildfires on or adjacent to national parks and state forests. Of these, more than 240 have occurred since 1 August, with the Mount Archer fire at Rockhampton being the most significant due to its proximity to town and surrounding rural residences. Forty staff worked a total of 2,300 hours on the Mount Archer fire this month. I want to take this opportunity to thank them for the hard work that they have been doing fighting this fire alongside the other agencies involved.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008033"></A>
Leading up to the fire this season, staff carried out two significant planned burns in the Mount Archer National Park and State Forest covering over 700 hectares. Ten kilometres of fire controls were also maintained in August and September this year as part of our annual fire management regime. This is on top of a previous nine planned burns in the Mount Archer National Park and State Forest in recent years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008034"></A>
Contingency planning is in place to maintain our high levels of response as the fire season progresses. This involves coordinating the deployment of rangers as necessary to assist in areas with the greatest need or to manage fatigue during fires of extended duration.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008035"></A>
Fire bans are currently in place for large parts of the state, and people planning to visit our parks and forests between now and Christmas should be very aware of any fire restrictions or park closures that may apply. The Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service is maintaining a level of high alert to respond to fires as they occur across the remainder of this extremely difficult and challenging fire season.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (10.28 am): My first question without notice is to the Minister for Sport. Terry Mackenroth has told the media that he wanted to cancel the A1GP contract two months ago. I ask: why did the minister mislead parliament on 15 and 17 September? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010071"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. The contract for the A1GP motor racing to attend the Nikon SuperGP was between A1GP World Cup of Motorsport Australia and the events promoter, the Gold Coast Motor Events Co. The Gold Coast Motor Events Co. is a partnership between the international management group and the Gold Coast events company. Details of the contract are governed by commercial-in-confidence, but will be available to both the Auditor-General and the Williams review. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010076"></A>
Until five days before the event, the promoter continued to receive written and public assurances from A1GP that it was participating in the 2009 Nikon SuperGP. A1GP organisers booked and paid deposits for accommodation, obtained visas for their drivers and booked pre-race training sessions at Queensland Raceways. If we had broken the contract, the taxpayer may have been liable. The contracting party to the Gold Coast Motor Events Co. has reserved its legal rights against A1GP. The independent Williams review will look at the circumstances surrounding the A1GP not participating in the event. Queensland and the Gold Coast community were let down by the A1GP organisation. </Hansard-Body>

 It was the Gold Coast community and all those who attended the event who did not let Queensland down. It was a great event.

I look forward to an even better event next year. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is also to the Minister for Sport. Given that the minister was chairman of the steering committee that met weekly with Mr David Williams on his recent review, is not his A1GP review just a smokescreen and another case of Labor mates investigating Labor mates? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010085"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. As we know there will be two independent reviews into this event. One review will be conducted by the Auditor-General and will focus on the contractual arrangements in relation to the A1GP component of this year’s SuperGP event. Every year the Auditor-General does the audit for the Gold Coast events company and the Gold Coast Motor Events Co. He has brought that audit forward and will also review the contractual arrangements. The second review will be conducted by David Williams, who has significant expertise in events management. This will be an independent review on the circumstances of the withdrawal of the A1GP and will look at how we can take the event forward. I say to those opposite that I believe there is nobody in Queensland who has more international and national experience in events than Mr Williams. I remind honourable members to look at the events that Mr Williams has been involved in for a number of years, both nationally and internationally. This review will look at all the questions. I will make myself, my staff and any information that we have available to both the Auditor-General and Mr Williams. </Hansard-Body>

 As a result of that, I look forward to making sure that next year, which is the 20th anniversary of this event, the event will be bigger and better than ever before. The attendance of 205,000 people attests to how great an event it was. Throughout Australia the television ratings were seven per cent higher than last year. The event was broadcast live in New Zealand. Twenty-six per cent of the Gold Coast’s international tourism market comes from New Zealand, making it the biggest contributor to that market. I support the event and I look forward to the review. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. There is no doubt that jurisdictions and governments around the world have been hit by a global financial crisis and have had to make economic decisions about how they will grow their economies through those tough times. My government has faced up to the hard decisions. Without doubt this has been the hardest decision that I have made as Premier. Frankly, I would prefer not to have to make this decision. I would much prefer not to have to face hard choices, but when you put your hand up for a leadership position it means facing the realities and the tough choices, whatever they are and whatever is thrown your way, whether from the world economy or any other source. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010094"></A>
I have always been a great supporter of the public ownership of public assets, but over the years I have learnt to be open-minded about the things that government should own and the things that government should hope to own in the future, and the things that government once owned and may no longer need to be in the business of. I was one of the people in the Australian Labor Party who was very opposed to the sale of Qantas. I look back and admit that I was wrong. Qantas has gone from strength to strength, with significant private investment that could never have been provided by the taxpayers of this country. What do we have? Of the First World countries, Australia has one of the smallest populations yet we have one of the top 10 airlines in the world, which employs more Australians than before and has enjoyed a complete reinvestment in its fleet. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010095"></A>
When it comes to this government’s decision, I absolutely understand that the community will have concerns and questions and there will be a debate about it. I want people to debate these issues. They are important issues. I welcome debate on this issue, but it is important that it is a well-informed debate. That means separating facts from myths and providing good quality, basic information to people. </Hansard-Body>

Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will take his interjection, ‘Besides New Zealand.’ Obviously he does not care about New Zealand. New Zealand is the Gold Coast’s biggest international tourism market at 26 per cent. Obviously, the member does not care about the Gold Coast’s biggest international tourism market. This event was broadcast live to New Zealand on both Saturday and Sunday. In fact, on Sunday in New Zealand the number of viewers peaked at 717,000. That country makes the biggest impact on the Gold Coast’s tourism market.</Hansard-Body>

I am advised by V8 Supercars that approximately 110 countries received broadcast quality feed of the event, including the SuperGP on the Gold Coast. Live vision is sent direct from the track to the international subscribers that pay for the footage. It is then scheduled into local programming. The Nikon SuperGP V8 Supercars racing was also broadcast live on the internet via BigPond Sport, which has 9.7 million subscribers. The event was shown live on free TV--</Hansard-Body>

Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Sorry--so they will see how beautiful the Gold Coast is a week late and that means that they will not come over here for tourism! The Bahrain International Circuit delivers the feed live to Al Jazeera and other networks in the Middle East. The Middle East is very much an emerging tourism market for the Gold Coast. These broadcasts run either live or delay. While more than 205,000 fans attended this event, Channel 7 TV ratings show that racing was also a big hit--around 2.15 million people in the major Australian metropolitan markets. Why? Because we want people from Melbourne to come here, we want New South Welshmen to come here, we want South Australians to come here and we want Western Australians to come here to the Gold Coast. It is about tourism, it is about jobs, it is about the economy.</Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the member for Clayfield, who seems to think that the Gateway Bridge is building itself and that Airport Link is building itself. Every one of these projects is creating and protecting jobs for Queenslanders. We took a decision in the toughest of economic times to keep that building program going. When we cannot do everything, we have to decide what is the most important--and keeping jobs in the construction industry is that important </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012169"></A>
What were the alternatives that we rejected? We could have cut the building program; we did not. We could have increased taxes such as payroll tax; we did not. We could have cut services in public schools and hospitals; we did not. That is the clear alternative. It is not a hypothetical alternative. We are watching it roll out in Western Australia right now. There is nothing theoretical about this. The Liberal and National parties approach this in a very clear way--cut jobs. They are cutting more than 400 jobs at Royal Perth Hospital. It is not a theoretical alternative for those opposite who said during the election campaign, ‘We get through an economic crisis by cutting jobs and slashing expenditure,’ and they have backed this policy up. As recently as 16 September the member for Clayfield was crowing about his support for the efficiency dividend. The member for Maroochydore in October said that their policy was about slowing the rate of growth in the public sector. That is code for fewer doctors, fewer nurses, fewer teachers, fewer police. That is what that adds up to.</Hansard-Body>

Best of all, members should watch the Leader of the Opposition on <Hansard-Italic>
Stateline</Hansard-Italic>
 from 16 October, because five times he was asked for his economic plan and five times he said that he did not have one. The interviewer asked over and over again. On five separate occasions the member for Surfers Paradise was asked, ‘What is your economic strategy?’ He has no plan to cut debt, no plan to reduce the deficit, no plan to grow Queensland’s economic growth, no plan to restore the AAA credit rating, no plan to create jobs and no plan to take Queensland forward. We will deliver for Queenslanders, we will grow the Queensland economy, we will protect jobs. Those opposite have no clue and no plan.</Hansard-Body>

Mrs SMITH:</Hansard-Member-Up>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Burleigh for her question and for her interest in ensuring that not only her constituents but all members of the Queensland public are properly informed about the government’s plans, because there are many myths out there in the community. If you talk to people, they believe that we are proposing to sell all of QR, when the fact is that we have always said from the start that the passenger side would be excluded from any sale process or any consideration. If you talk to people in the community, they believe the myth propagated by those opposite that these are somehow cash cow businesses, when the fact is that they contributed 0.9 per cent of budgeted revenue last financial year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012200"></A>
It is those opposite who are seeking to propagate the most myths in this debate. They are seeking to propagate the myth that they actually oppose this when the fact is that they support it hand over fist. The fact is that they went to the last election with a platform that said--and I quote from page 86 of the platform--‘The sale of government commercial enterprises should be considered.’ There is a fact against the myth. Then in February this year the then Leader of the Opposition came in with his economic blueprint and what did it say? For a fact it said, ‘An LNP government would not oppose the privatisation of public assets.’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012202"></A>
The fact is that when those opposite were in government last time they spent $1 million on a commission of audit which recommended selling the ports and the motorways. The fact is that they then spent $1.9 million on a program office to implement that. The fact is that they question our decision to spend money to properly inform the Queensland public, when they supported the sale of Telstra and the spending of $51 million on promoting that program. The fact is that they think it is all right to spend taxpayers’ money on glamour shots of the Leader of the Opposition, when they have also supported the spending of $121 million on a Work Choices campaign.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012204"></A>
Let there be no myth about where the LNP members stand on this. They believe in selling off. They sold off the Liberal Party last year. Clearly what we need to understand here is this: this is a group of people who have learnt nothing from the last election. They still believe in the efficiency dividend. The shadow minister said two weeks ago that their job creation target is zero. The Leader of the Opposition has been asked five times on television last week: ‘What is your plan?’ The fact is that he could not answer. He believes in growing the Queensland economy. He is going to have a cheerleader-led recovery, where all he needs to do is cheer the Queensland economy home and everything is going to be sorted out.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012205"></A>
The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition cannot answer the question. He has 10 minutes at the end of question time and he should stand up and stand for something. He should finally say what he stands for. On radio yesterday he said that he was not really enjoying the job and it was tough what the government threw at him. Leadership is about making decisions. I think the people of Queensland, and in fact all voters around Queensland, would like to see the Leader of the Opposition have a cup of concrete and harden up and make some tough decisions.</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Treasurer. When was the Treasurer, as Acting Premier from 16 October, informed of Mr Mackenroth’s resignation from Gold Coast Motor Events Co.? And was he complicit in the cover-up of that resignation and the cancellation of the A1GP? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012249"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. I spoke to Mr Mackenroth late on the Sunday afternoon as Acting Premier. I telephoned him about the event, and he advised me at that stage of his intention to offer his resignation to take effect after the event--a matter which has been made public since that time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012250"></A>
On this front, let us be really clear about the government’s resolve here. Our focus very firmly was on making sure that there was a great event last weekend on the Gold Coast. I, for one, went along. I took my kids along to the event, because it is a great event for the Gold Coast. It speaks volumes that we have seen a Leader of the Opposition who has stood by for months happy to see the henchmen pull apart this event, because he is unable to stand up for anything--not even his own electorate, not even an event on the Gold Coast that is so important. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012251"></A>
There is only one person who has enjoyed what has happened over the last couple of weeks, and that is the Leader of the Opposition. He cannot stand up for the Gold Coast. He cannot stand up for his own electorate. He cannot stand up for anything. He asked a question on notice the last time we were here opposing climate change--never a bigger example of just how far a member of this parliament who used to contribute has been bankrupted and overcome by the rump of the policy dinosaurs that twiddled his strings. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012254"></A>
What we have seen is the biggest sell-out and the biggest sell-off in the history of this parliament. We have a Leader of the Opposition who will not stand for anything. What do we stand for? We stand for supporting events like that on the Gold Coast. We stand for supporting the V8 event at Townsville. If you want a better example of why regional events like that are so important, talk to anyone from Townsville about the way that game changed. They opposed that. They opposed our efforts to make sure that the Gold Coast gets these sorts of events, because the reality is that, when it comes down to it, they stand for nothing. They stand for nothing when it comes to the Gold Coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012255"></A>
The truth is: what decent Liberal and National voters want is a Leader of the Opposition who stands for something, who can actually put a policy forward. There are 10 minutes after question time, as I said. Last week the Leader of the Opposition asked us to all hang around. I am happy to hang around after question time and hopefully we will get 10 minutes of finally hearing what the Leader of the Opposition stands for, instead of 10 minutes of puffery and whatever the old Nats got him to say in the morning. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr O’BRIEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade. Could the minister please outline for the House exactly what types of economic development opportunities are supported by the Queensland government’s wild rivers policy? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012262"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. He is a member who retains a very keen interest in the issue of wild rivers declarations. It is fair to say that in recent weeks we have heard a number of comments in the media, particularly in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
, regarding the issue of wild rivers and its alleged impact on economic development opportunities, particularly in Cape York. I think it is time to set the record straight.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012263"></A>
Since departmental staff began consulting on wild river declarations in Cape York in 2007, there have literally been hundreds of meetings and submissions received on the issue of wild rivers declarations in various catchments or basins within Cape York. It would be wrong to suggest that all of those, or indeed a majority of those, oppose wild rivers declarations including those submitted by traditional owners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012264"></A>
I think it is important to note that the commentary we have seen in the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
 over the last number of months from certain individuals does not speak for all traditional owners in Cape York. Whilst their opinion is important and recognised, they do not speak for all traditional owners. In fact, there are many traditional owners who support wild river declarations in catchments affecting their communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012265"></A>
I think it needs to be understood that, when initial concerns by some Indigenous leaders were brought to the attention of the former Premier--and, indeed, the then Deputy Premier--this government responded. How did it respond? It responded by introducing the Cape York Peninsula Heritage Act, which hard-wired into legislation passed by this parliament that wild river declarations would do a number of things: (1) they would not impact on native title and (2) they would recognise legitimate economic development opportunities for Indigenous communities in Cape York. I challenge anyone who can be bothered--unlike some commentators--to read the content of these wild river declarations, because what they will see there is listed allocations of water for economic development purposes and a raft of other opportunities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012268"></A>
The simple fact is that in answer to the question, ‘What economic development opportunities have wild rivers stopped in those basins where declarations have been finalised?’ nobody has been able to provide details of one project that has been stopped as a result of wild river declarations. It is time to deal with the facts. I invite publications, including the <Hansard-Italic>
Australian</Hansard-Italic>
, to take a far more balanced approach to this and even do the courtesy of asking the minister responsible to respond to wild and inaccurate allegations that are published--</Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. In 2005 the Premier was part of a cabinet decision to replace respected former News Corp identity John Cowley with Labor mate Terry Mackenroth as chairman of the Gold Coast Motor Events Co. Will the Premier today remind Queenslanders what attributes the cabinet thought Mr Mackenroth possessed, beyond being a Labor mate, that made him the better option for this position? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012279"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I am on the record over the last couple of weeks making it clear that I think Mr Mackenroth has provided a great service to the sport of motor racing, particularly on the Gold Coast, over a number of years, both as minister for sport and as the chair of Indy. He has indicated to me and publicly that, both because of the time that he has served and because of recent events, he believes it is time for the event to have new leadership. I recognise the work that he has done to make this a great event over many, many years.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012280"></A>
I was disappointed, along with other Queenslanders, particularly those who are motor-racing fans and particularly those from the Gold Coast, with the decision by the A1 to withdraw from this event. I do not hide my displeasure about the way that they have conducted themselves at all. In my view they have been misleading, and I look forward to seeing the Auditor-General’s report in that regard. But there was one person who was very happy with the decision. There was one person who was positively gleeful about the decision, and that is the member for Surfers Paradise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012281"></A>
Those of us who watch the member for Surfers Paradise around the halls of this parliament see him with gloomy, down and despondent looks all the time. He gets around this place like Eeyore, with a little black rain cloud hanging over his head--sad and sour. That is the member for Surfers Paradise and the member for Southern Downs--sad and sour. But wasn’t there a spring in his step the minute his backyard was in trouble? Everybody else put their shoulder to the wheel and had a real ‘make it happen’ attitude, but the member for Surfers Paradise went as far as having a press conference to say that this tarnished the reputation of the Gold Coast as a destination.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012284"></A>
Let me make it absolutely clear: the Gold Coast is a world-class destination. And that was proved on the weekend. In my view, it came through a test with flying colours, no thanks to the member for Surfers Paradise, who saw a problem in his own backyard and jumped for joy, jumped gleefully.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is my pleasure to respond to the member’s question. What we are committed to doing is giving kids in Queensland a flying start in terms of their educational future. We know that the early childhood years are vital to the future success of kids in school. That is why we have made the tough budget choices this year that have enabled us to continue rolling out, in conjunction with the federal government, a major funding program for kindergartens across Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020168"></A>
We are putting about $320 million into providing up to 240 extra kindergarten services in schools. We are making a subsidy available that will help offset the provision of kindergarten programs in long day care centres. We have called for expressions of interest for the first 100. They are rolling in. We are also upgrading the work that is being done with the Creche and Kindergarten Association around the provision of kindergarten programs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020169"></A>
What we are doing with this program is creating and supporting Queensland jobs, building critical social infrastructure and boosting the educational opportunities of our young Queenslanders--our four-year-olds. Why are we focused on this? We want to lift the participation rate of four-year-olds in kindergarten programs in Queensland up to 90 to 95 per cent over the next four to five years so that we put underneath our education system the second major plank in alignment with the prep year that we introduced. This is going to make a big difference to our kids in school. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012331"></A>
While we are doing this, unfortunately the member for Moggill is continuing with his Flegg furphies. We are up to about No. 14 or 15. He has made a number of claims. I want to set the record straight. For example, he has made the claim that our kindergarten reforms will mean that religious schools are only eligible for funding through C&amp;K. The facts are that they can accept funding independently of C&amp;K. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012332"></A>
Another claim he made is that local communities have to raise additional funds to top up wages--fact. Child-care and kindergarten programs are provided by the private sector who set their fees, and our subsidy will help offset the cost of that provision just like it does with C&amp;K now. He has claimed that there will not be enough teachers. The facts are that there are over 900 early childhood education teachers graduating from Queensland universities each year. We will also be working with the sector to upgrade the skills of workers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012333"></A>
Another claim he made is that teaching qualifications will be lowered. That is wrong. The facts are that the funding model takes into account the industrial awards. On many of these fronts we are making very big reforms. The claims are a myth and the facts show that that is so. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Tony Cochrane and the V8 Supercars are a great Queensland company. In fact, they are based at Nerang on the Gold Coast. The V8 Supercar teams employ over 700 workers in South-East Queensland. As soon as they found out about A1GP pulling out they wanted to get behind the event because they know how important it is for the Gold Coast economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012341"></A>
As a result, they spoke to their teams and all the teams agreed to have, for the first time ever, four 150-kilometre races. Obviously, there was some expense in that regard. That was up to the promoters. It was not up to the Queensland taxpayers to pay that. We had already put in our money. It was the promoters’ job to pay for that.

Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I want to thank the honourable member for the question. After spending some time with her last week, I know that she is passionate about child protection issues. More than 4,000 volunteer foster and kinship carers around the state are currently providing stable and loving homes for more than 6,600 children who cannot live safely at home. These children have been abused or neglected and their foster or kinship carers are giving them a second chance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012365"></A>
This year the Bligh government has committed another record budget of $638 million to child protection, including more than $80 million to directly support the work of foster and kinship carers. I am pleased to be able to advise the House that following our highly successful recruitment campaign last year I have recently approved extra funds for non-government organisations to train, access and support nearly 55 extra foster and kinship carers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012367"></A>
On the Sunshine Coast Cooloola Foster and Kinship Care will receive more than $1.4 million over three years to train, assess and support foster and kinship carers to care for 90 children on the Sunshine Coast. This represents an increase of almost half a million dollars a year to provide places for an extra 25 children in care. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012371"></A>
In North Queensland, Pathways--Thuringowa Foster and Kinship Care--will also receive more than $1.4 million over three years to train, assess and support the care for 90 children. This funding represents an increase of about half a million dollars a year to Pathways. In both of these cases, the funding boost includes an allocation to assist NGOs to meet their financial pressures, including wage rises for their workers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012372"></A>
As we all know, foster and kinship carers are the backbone of the child protection system. They help children and young people recover and move on from abuse and neglect from their parents. Without those volunteers who receive nothing but payments to meet the cost of raising another child, we could not do the job that we do in Child Safety Services. I want to thank the foster and kinship carers for doing a great job 24 hours a day, seven days a week every year, year in, year out. I commend them on behalf of everyone in the House. </Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Sport. As far back as 18 January 2000, the UK Labour government minister of state, Peter Hain, warned that the CEO of A1GP, Tony Teixeira, supplied diesel to Angolan guerrillas in contravention of UN sanctions. Did the minister at any time investigate these very serious claims as part of due diligence? </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for the question. The International Management Group of America, the management partner of the events promoter, is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the event and undertook a due diligence process on the A1GP. As members would understand, IMG is not an arm of the government. The sanction agreement with the A1GP is between the event promoter and the A1GP. The facts are that at the time of entering into the sanction agreement the A1GP was successfully staging its 2008-09 series and has since completed that series. Any financial difficulties the company may have had were not disclosed at that time. It goes without saying that the actions of A1GP--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It goes without saying that the actions of the A1GP organisation, particularly over the past month, have badly let down the people of the Gold Coast, the event promoter and, ultimately, motor-racing fans. The Gold Coast Motor Events Co. has obviously reserved its legal rights against the A1GP. However, once again, I would like to acknowledge and thank all of those involved in bringing this event together. All aspects, particularly the due diligence process, will be considered by both the Auditor-General and--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Obviously, those opposite want to go back to the past and have the situation where the loss of any event such as this event would have come straight from the taxpayers. We have a system in place whereby the promoter, IMG, is responsible for any loss in that regard. Our grant to the Gold Coast Motor Events Co. is to ensure employment, to ensure that the grandstands are built, that the volunteers are trained, that events are marketed and, obviously, categories like the V8 Supercars are arranged for, in this case, the A1GP. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015238"></A>
 It is the responsibility of IMG to present that to the Gold Coast Motor Events Co. This is the kind of stuff that the Auditor-General and the Williams review will consider. I think it is appropriate to wait and see what they say before making any comments about whether that due diligence process was carried out effectively. </Hansard-Body>

Ms MALE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. Can the Deputy Premier advise the House how the Bligh government’s commitment to creating and supporting jobs, not job cuts, can pay dividends for our efforts to recruit more doctors and nurses in Queensland for our hospitals? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015243"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Australia has weathered the global financial crisis in terms that are the envy of most other developed nations in the world. The philosophy that has related to Australia and the way in which it has conducted itself is one that the Queensland government has also been committed to. That is a policy that recognises the importance of a capital building program that not only creates jobs but also creates and builds the future. Every time we build a hospital we create not only the jobs for those people who actually build it but also jobs for people who work in it. Also, of course, that hospital benefits the people who will use it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015244"></A>
Our $6 billion infrastructure program in Health will create 40,000 jobs. Since 2005 we have employed 12,500 more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals alone. It passes strange, does it not, that we again continue to see the opposition’s claim of opposition to the government’s proposal of selective privatisation. The entire workforce of Queensland Rail is about 15,000 at the moment, having grown as a result of an increase in the coal and passenger businesses. The coal business in Queensland employs about 1,700 people. Yet in a 4-year period we have grown our health workforce--doctors, nurses and allied professionals--by 12,500.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015245"></A>
 Mr Speaker, that coat of arms that stands behind you indicates what Queensland did traditionally. One hundred years ago in this state, schools were non-existent. Most people here--probably with the exception of the member for Moggill--would not have gone to secondary school. We had six grammar schools in Queensland. Now we have 400 or so secondary schools. Expenditure on communities was non-existent. No-one had heard of disability funding. We had a handful of hospitals throughout the place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015246"></A>
One thing that distinguishes that time from this time is that then we had state butcher shops, we had state hotels, we had state jam companies, we had state ports. One thing on this side of the House compared to the other side of the House is that that side is the party of old-bloke policy. We are the party of 21st century policy development that recognises where this state is going in the future. What is more, the members opposite know it. They know that the issue is about choices, because the Vince FitzGerald Commission of Audit gave them the blueprint of what they should do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1015249"></A>
It is a competition for capital in governments, just as it is for companies in the private sector. I make no apology whatsoever for saying that. The opposition wants more and more hospital beds built. The AMA wants 3,750 Australia-wide. We will deliver half of that number under our program in Queensland alone. It is a contest for capital. I say to the people of Queensland that I want the money for hospitals, I want the money for schools, I want the money for disability services. Let the mining companies and people who use toll roads pay for services in the appropriate way. It is a contest for capital, and human services must always win.</Hansard-Body>

With the proposed removal of research operations from the QPIF research facility at Kingaroy to Toowoomba, the minister’s department has informed me that the facility at Kingaroy will now be known as an agricultural centre. I ask: exactly what services will the station be offering? Will any part of the facility’s assets be sold, and I include any land used in the facility’s previous research capacity? Will there be any added benefits because of the change to the area? </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the member for her question. I know her interest in these issues and their importance in her own electorate. As the member may be aware, the government, through the department of primary industry and fisheries, has embarked on a significant reform and restructure of QPIF’s research and development capacity. It is doing this in partnership with all of the major agricultural peak bodies to ensure that, as we recast our efforts in this respect, we get it right. </Hansard-Body>

That will bring together for the first time anywhere in Australia researchers from CSIRO, QPIF and the Environmental Protection Authority in a world-class, brand-new, purpose-built research facility. They will be researching in areas of critical 21st century importance--areas to do with water and water allocations, farm techniques and environmental issues. This will give our department of primary industries a cutting edge that they do not have in any other part of Australia.</Hansard-Body>

Ms van LITSENBURG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer the minister to representations I have made about safe work practices in Redcliffe.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017777"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DICK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for her question and her interest in workplace health and safety matters. This week is Safe Work Australia Week. It started on Sunday and it will go all the way through until next Saturday. Very tragically, 100 Queenslanders die in their workplaces each year. That is, regrettably, two people per week. Another 30,000 suffer from very serious injury or disease relating to their work. On average, 82 Queensland workers are absent from their workplaces on any given day because of those serious work related injuries or illnesses.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017778"></A>
The financial cost to the state is very significant--up to $5.2 billion a year--but the real tragedy and loss is the incalculable cost in human suffering. The Queensland government wants to turn these statistics around to ensure that people make it home safe and sound to their loved ones--their family members and friends--at the end of each working day. The Queensland government wants to work with employers and workers to build positive zero harm safety cultures in all Queensland workplaces to reduce the number and severity of workplace incidents.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017779"></A>
Part of this approach is supporting Safe Work Australia Week. Workplace Health and Safety Queensland has organised a range of events around Queensland to raise awareness and emphasise the importance of safe workplaces. I was delighted this morning to attend a builders’ breakfast seminar with one of our workplace safety ambassadors, rugby league legend Mal Meninga. Mal spoke about his approach to health and safety, the impact a workplace injury had had on his father and his family and the importance of coming home safely each day. Tonight I will present the 2009 Work Safe Awards and the Return to Work Awards. These awards are a unique opportunity for Queensland businesses to recognise their commitment to excellence in workplace health and safety. The awards reward genuine accident and injury prevention efforts by promoting best practice.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017780"></A>
We have Injury Free Day taking place this Friday, a day where we are asking schools and other Queensland workplaces to make a commitment to have a day without injuries. There are a range of other events: in Mackay today, rugby league legend Shane Webcke--one of our other safety ambassadors--will be speaking about the tragedy in his family when his father was tragically killed in a farming accident. We are launching a DVD today telling the very sad story of an Innisfail farmer, Garry Nichols, who lost a leg in an horrific tractor accident. That DVD sends a simple message: think about the grief and hardship your family will endure if you are killed or injured in the workplace and take steps to take action to deal with risks in the workplace. Our involvement in Safe Work Australia Week is another example of the Bligh government’s positive commitment to improving the lives of all Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships. Can the minister explain what has been done to assist Indigenous councils like Yarrabah in my electorate of Mulgrave to meet their statutory reporting requirements?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017790"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BOYLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. He is a strong supporter of the Yarrabah Aboriginal Shire Council and, in fact, of the community of Yarrabah in general. The Auditor-General’s report on results of local government audits tabled in this place on 20 May highlighted that improvements needed to be made in statutory reporting amongst a number of the Indigenous councils. I am pleased to say that my government has taken up that issue through the department and with a panel of experts and worked very closely with the Aboriginal councils and we have, in fact, turned the situation around dramatically.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017791"></A>
Last year the Auditor-General reported that all 12 continuing Aboriginal shire councils and the Aurukun and Mornington shire councils did not meet the legislative financial reporting time frames for the 2007-08 financial statements, and in fact by 30 April 2009 only two of these councils had their financial statements finalised by management and auditors’ opinions issued. That is not a good situation and, unfortunately, one that has in previous years been reported to the House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017792"></A>
This year, however, the story is very different. I am very proud on behalf of the Aboriginal councils to report to the House that 14 of the 16 identified Indigenous councils completed their financial statements and provided them for audit by the 15 September due date. Audits are now progressing or planned in all of these councils much earlier than the previous financial year. The Northern Peninsula Area Regional Council has had an extension, and I have to say for very good reasons. It is a multiple council amalgamation with a history of not good financial records in the component councils. It has had a very difficult job and it is no wonder that an extension has been needed. The second council to require an extension was Kowanyama Aboriginal Shire Council, which then submitted its financial statements in early October. The statements were only a matter of weeks late. The reason for that very short delay was a delay in receiving updated asset valuation data.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017793"></A>
There is no doubt that this is a huge improvement and that the Aboriginal councils need congratulating. They have made a significant turnaround. It has been a tremendous effort on the part of the CEOs and their staff to meet these important deadlines. They were assisted by an eminent task force of people and by my department and I thank and congratulate all who were involved.</Hansard-Body>

 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (11.31 am): As I go around the state and talk about issues of the economy that the government is providing stewardship of and service delivery, I constantly get the message--whether I am in the Torres Strait, as I was last week, or Townsville or Charters Towers, as I was last weekend, or Toowoomba or Rockhampton--that this is a government that cannot plan, cannot build and cannot deliver. There is no better example of it than we have seen again today when prosecuting arguments about the Gold Coast SuperGP. That event, held over the last weekend, was again shown to be poorly planned by this minister, who could not and will not answer the questions and clearly misled the parliament just a short month ago on 2 September when he read from a press release and also on 15 September and 17 September. Of course, in answer to our questions the Premier always states that if we have any information it should be provided to the appropriate authorities. Very obviously, that is what we did in this House on 2 September and on 15 and 17 September. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024310"></A>
The opposition was doing the work of the government in looking into these issues about the financial circumstances of the A1GP. Clearly, the government is ready for opposition and this opposition is ready for government. Once again the minister today was making a silk purse out of a sow’s ear and trying to say that last year’s event had 297,000 people attending and this year’s event had 205,000 people attending but somehow this year was more successful because television ratings were up on some TV channels. I know the people who own the businesses in Surfers Paradise. I know the people in the five-star hotels which the Premier said were fully booked, but I know they were not. The revenue was down 30 per cent and 40 per cent. The planning that was supposed to have been done clearly was not done. There are serious questions for this minister to answer, including the questions about ministerial responsibility that clearly this government has abrogated. There is form from this government about doing that over the years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024311"></A>
The minister is condemned by his own words of 15 September. His answer at page 2208 of <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024313"></A>
All the advice I am receiving from the partnership management committee of the Nikon SuperGP is that the event is going ahead as planned. It is well planned and it is going to be a great event. Because of the repetitive rumour mongering the opposition engages in, I sought a briefing with the partnership committee about the actions it has undertaken ... I have received the briefing and have had personal discussions with the chairman of the A1GP as late as yesterday to satisfy myself--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1024314"></A>
that is, on 14 September. Yet that chairman, Terry Mackenroth, has since said that he had questions. He said on the <Hansard-Italic>
7.30 Report</Hansard-Italic>
 last week--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024316"></A>
We dearly would have liked to have said to them a month or two months ago--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1024317"></A>
therefore, that was in August--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024318"></A>
‘Look, you’re going to come. We don’t think you’re going to come. So we’re going to cancel the contract.’</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024319"></A>
It begs the question again. The chairman supposedly had discussions with the minister on the day before 15 September, yet the minister comes in here and tells us that the event is on track and that we should stop questioning it. So we asked again through the shadow minister for sport, the honourable member for Bundaberg, the same question about due diligence: had the government done the appropriate work and made the appropriate inquiries? Again, the minister stood up on 17 September and said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024320"></A>
I say to those opposite that they should stop listening to rumour and innuendo.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1024322"></A>
Let us have a look at some quotes from other people. The boss of V8s, Tony Cochrane, says--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024323"></A>
Only an idiot would think there wasn’t a problem with A1GP in the months leading up to this event. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024324"></A>
Clearly, it begs the question as to what he thinks of the member for Mansfield, the minister. Very obviously, even the columnist in the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
, whom the Premier welcomed back to parliament--and we welcome back to the media gallery--Sue Lappeman, said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024326"></A>
It is now official, everything this Government touches turns to crap. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024332"></A>
We have quotes from numerous people saying that there should have been more due diligence done here. Of course, we have the honourable the Treasurer, who is questioning the questions that we have asked about this. He is like Sleepy from the <Hansard-Italic>
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</Hansard-Italic>
 sitting over there between Dopey and Dozey. He was asleep while we lost our AAA credit rating. He may not have noticed that we voted against privatisation and selectively quotes from the platform of the LNP. Very clearly, we told the people what our plans were before the election and we will stick to what we told the people of Queensland before the election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024333"></A>
Very clearly, the Treasurer ignored the warning signs that were there. He is like Gollum out of control. Very obviously, he comes out with things that he does when obviously the Bligh Labor government has not done its own due diligence investigations. The minister has misled the parliament. He has concealed information from the public about the resignation--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024342"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I say, it is up to the minister to look at the words he used in this House on 15 and 17 September and abide by Westminster principles. They are that he is responsible for the things that happen with his department and he cannot abrogate that responsibility. Very obviously, given the form of this government, he is not prepared to do that. That is something that again shows that he is expressing confidence in this House that the other members of this House and the people of Queensland clearly do not have.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024343"></A>
If this were a private company, the minister would be seen as the CEO and the Premier as chairman of the board. With the share price having gone through the floor, the shareholders would be demanding a purge of the board and of the CEO, and that is exactly what this minister will not take responsibility for. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024344"></A>
The other issue that has come up over the last couple of days is the privatisation campaign. Again we heard the Treasurer speaking today. Members opposite have no shame. They come into this place and talk about the fact that they have to take these hard decisions on behalf of the people of Queensland when the Treasurer was asleep at the wheel and did not see the warning signs that we were to lose our AAA credit rating. Now the Premier is saying that she welcomes debate on this matter. Very clearly, we had that debate in June and we voted against the privatisations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024345"></A>
We have said very clearly that we oppose the privatisations. The government now spending another $1.9 million on this campaign shows how it has no respect for the people of Queensland. Those opposite deceived the people of Queensland about their privatisation plans, deceived us about the election date, deceived us about the 100,000 jobs they are creating and of course deceived us about the fire sale of assets. Now they are trying to buy their way out of trouble. They have no shame to come in here and try to turn around these issues of the A1GP and privatisation. They talk about protecting jobs and keeping Queensland strong, but all the statistics prove them to be not telling the truth. It is due to their management of the economy that they failed to keep our AAA credit rating. It is also a pity that the Premier did not spend $1.9 million of Labor Party money telling Queenslanders the truth instead of now spending taxpayers’ money to explain why she did not tell the truth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024381"></A>
What makes it even more galling is that the Treasurer and Premier have said that they will cut back on government spending in these tough economic times. This is a government that spends more on advertising than McDonald’s, Toyota and Myer. Of course, recently it has also spent $1 million on the ‘saving jobs’ tour, which should have been called ‘saving the Premier’s job’. Once again, despite all of the promises to cut back, the government is spending another $1.99 million. While telling the truth costs nothing, so far telling untruths has cost taxpayers $3 million and counting. Having helped to elect this government through union donations for campaigns, which totalled up to $600,000, the unions are now saying that they are unhappy about it. A number of members of the ETU have said that they are very unhappy and that this will rebound on Labor.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024384"></A>
However, the government will not listen. It is set in its ways, as is obvious from the issues surrounding the Abbot Point Coal Terminal, Queensland Rail assets, Queensland Motorways, the Port of Brisbane and Forestry Plantations Queensland. This week a release showed that the profit of Forestry Plantations Queensland has gone down which will affect any sale price that it will achieve. That is the very point that we made during our election campaign which the Treasurer refused to quote from fully. He quotes selectively. Obviously, you do not sell these things off in a depressed time in the market and when debts are associated with the asset. From the start we have said that, if they are not sold, we will not sell them. That is our commitment to the people of Queensland, but our greatest commitment is to tell them what we will do before an election and, most importantly, to stick to it after an election.<Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms STONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Springwood--ALP) (11.41 am): At the last sitting I informed the House of a funeral industry forum being organised by Metropolitan Funerals. Firstly, I want to thank organiser and panel member, Mr Brian Gill, who is the general manager of Metropolitan Funerals. I thank other panel industry representatives who attended the forum, including Mrs Esther Swanborough, from Swanborough Funerals, who is President of the Independent Funeral Directors Association; Mr Alistair Shaw, career embalmer and funeral director for 30 years; Mr Robert Luscombe, who is the cemeteries service manager with the Sunshine Coast Regional Council and President of the Queensland Cemeteries and Crematoria Association; and representatives from the AFDA. I also thank the master of ceremonies, Ms Annette Lourigan, who is the community relations manager with Metropolitan Funerals, for doing a wonderful job on the day and for her hard work in organising the forum.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1188196"></A>
My colleague the member for Pumicestone attended with me. I know that this week she is meeting with an industry person to find out more about ecofriendly coffins. We both found the forum very informative and look forward to working with the industry in the future. Community members who attended included Logan Local Ambulance Committee members, Ipswich city councillors and individuals who had questions regarding the industry. I was very pleased with the number of people representing all areas of the industry who turned up on the day and put forward their views on the future of the industry and asked questions of the industry panellists.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024397"></A>
I will now speak about some of the issues raised on the day.  People can sometimes be very confused as to who is the executor of a will or who has legal responsibility for organising a funeral. The forum heard how funeral directors can have a number of different directors turn up to pick up a deceased person because family members have phoned different companies as they all believed they were the person responsible for doing so. Then they have to wait for proof of who is the executor. This can be a problem also when it comes to collecting ashes. Sometimes there can be a dispute as to the ownership of the ashes and people are told to seek legal advice. Both industry representatives and individuals gave details of their experiences with this matter and both would like to see a more simplified method of dealing with such issues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024398"></A>
Of course, green choices was an area that received lots of questions. Often funeral directors have to weigh up family members’ wishes while trying to be good corporate citizens. A good example of this is when family members wish to release balloons, yet we know this is dangerous to our environment, especially to our sea creatures. Today as more alternative services are being requested, directors often have to balance the OH&amp;S risks to their staff and risks to the environment while trying to provide the type of service the family requests.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024399"></A>
We also heard about local government planning issues: what we will do in the future if space for cemeteries is not planned; who will pay for the cost of their maintenance as they become more and more costly for councils to continue to service; will more people be asking for green choices and will green cemeteries play a role in planning? Of course, the costs of funerals was well discussed and we all have different ideas about what we would call a simple funeral. It was suggested that people look at prearranged and prepaid funerals, as this could assist in allowing family members to know exactly what the person wants. It was suggested that people look at this as if it were any other major purchase. I believe that as Australians we are not comfortable doing this. It is only recently that the nation started talking publicly about organ donation, but I think the time has come for Australians to take more notice of this subject and they should plan and discuss with family members details of their expectations for their funerals or have it prearranged. People do not really know what they are paying for and they only see a casket at the service on the day. We do not understand the industry and we need more information. I have suggested to the industry that it print a brochure where the minimum requirements--that is, the must-do items--are explained and priced. The brochure would then explain the add-on services and costs so that people can make an informed decision about what they think would be a simple funeral.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024400"></A>
The forum also dealt with the matter of regulation. Currently there is no comprehensive regulation of the funeral industry in Queensland, although there are miscellaneous provisions across a number of portfolios that have an impact on the industry. On the day it was clear that the industry wants transparency. Many believe that a code of conduct would assist people in understanding what it is the industry does. For example, many people do not know that it can take 40 hours of work to prepare for a funeral. The industry wants to talk about moving down the regulation path. It wants to talk about standards, training and qualifications for staff, staff safety and public safety and doing the best to make sure the public gets the best service possible. The industry does not want small family owned firms pushed out of the industry. It wants them to survive and it wants the large companies to work alongside them. I look forward to meeting with the Attorney-General and representatives of the industry next month to start communication between this government and the industry as it progresses down this path.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Gateway Upgrade Project</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Speech-Start>
</Hansard-Speech-Start>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (11.46 am): I rise to inform the House of the imminent completion of the Gateway Motorway upgrade project. Motorists who regularly make the drive over the existing Gateway Bridge would have noticed the gap in the middle closing at a rapid rate of 10 metres every four days. It took six years to construct the original Gateway Bridge, but thanks to modern construction methods the new bridge will be completed in just over three years. By the end of this month, about 157,000 tonnes of concrete and 11,600 tonnes of reinforced steel will have been used to complete the substructure and the 1.63-kilometre bridge superstructure. The new bridge will connect with the new seven kilometre section of the Gateway Motorway north of the Brisbane River, completed in July this year, and the 12-kilometre Gateway Motorway upgrade south of the river, which is due for completion early next year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024404"></A>
When the bridge is opened in mid-2010 the project will have provided for 6,000 jobs, with a flow-on effect into the local economy of about $450 million in wages and salaries, and 50,000 vehicles are expected to start using it daily from the first day. I know the significant benefits it will provide for the people of the Bulimba electorate. The electorate is a high-density area showing continued growth. There is a clear need for investment in transport and road infrastructure to deliver residents a change in their commuting time. The Gateway Upgrade Project will deliver on this. With an estimated total cost of $1.88 billion, it is expected to cut travel time on the Gateway Motorway by 15 minutes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024405"></A>
The progressive opening of completed sections of the Gateway Upgrade Project, together with the implementation of free-flow tolling, has already delivered more reliable, safer and easier travel on the Gateway Motorway. However, it is not just the people of the Bulimba electorate who will benefit from this major piece of infrastructure. This project is an example of the legacy the government’s record $18.2 billion capital building program will leave for the people of Queensland. When the first Gateway Bridge opened in 1986, it was used by 12,500 vehicles per day, which increased to 17,000 a day after the first year. Now, more than 100,000 vehicles travel across the bridge each day. At the time the Bjelke-Petersen government said that the bridge would not reach its capacity for 50 years, but here we are, less than 25 years later, close to finishing the construction of its duplication.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024406"></A>
Queensland is experiencing exponential growth, with the largest population rise of all mainland states. As a government we must keep pace with the enormous demand this population growth is placing on our front-line services and infrastructure. This has not been easy. In recent times, the global financial crisis has affected every economy around the world. The crisis has cost the Queensland economy $15 billion in future income, a loss that would have effectively stopped vital works like the Gateway Upgrade Project unless funds could be found from other sources.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024445"></A>
The opposition would have us stop major infrastructure projects like this. However, the government has made the hard decision to sell five commercial businesses to reduce state debt and continue the building program. In doing so, we protected 127,000 jobs across the state and ensured the delivery of the vital infrastructure that our growing state needs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024448"></A>
The Gateway Motorway upgrade project will be delivered ahead of schedule and on budget. In fact, due to savings realised through good contracting, the scope of the project was able to be altered so that the Gateway Motorway will be widened to eight lanes instead of six lanes between Wynnum Road and Old Cleveland Road--a significant benefit for the Bulimba electorate. Savings in the project have also meant a one-kilometre section was upgraded from four to six lanes north of the new airport interchange, including a 740-metre bridge over the Kedron Brook flood plain.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024449"></A>
A particularly appealing aspect of the Gateway upgrade is the inclusion of a pedestrian and cycle way. This is another example of the commitment of the Bligh government to embracing active transport options that will deliver important outcomes for our community, including benefits for health, the environment and the interconnectedness of our local communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024450"></A>
The impending completion of the Gateway Motorway upgrade project will also mark the delivery of just one of the many vital infrastructure projects that are underway across the state as a result of this government’s responsible economic management of the worst financial crisis in the last 70 years. The Gateway Motorway upgrade project is a key infrastructure project that will serve the growing needs of our state and provide important stimulus to our economy. The people of the Bulimba electorate welcome the impending completion of this project. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Queensland Bushfires</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Speech-Start>
</Hansard-Speech-Start>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MALONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mirani--LNP) (11.51 am): Today in the matters of public interest debate I rise to speak about the major bushfires we have seen across Queensland over the last two months. There have been serious fires right across Queensland. I rise today to express my absolute admiration for all of those who have been involved from the volunteer rural fire brigades, the SES, auxiliary and urban firefighters and of course the police. These people have gone out of their way and, in some cases, put their lives on the line to protect life and property throughout Queensland. I join with the minister today in congratulating and supporting those people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024456"></A>
There have been some major fires in Central Queensland, from Bundaberg to Mount Morgan to Bouldercombe. Certainly, the one that had the most potential for loss of life and loss of homes was the huge fire at Rockhampton in the Mount Archer National Park, which included the world-renowned Berserker wilderness area. More than 800 homes were at risk and 11,000 hectares, or 30,000 acres, were burnt out and destroyed. Millions of animals and mammals were killed and much of the unique ecosystems will never grow back. At another time in this place I will speak about how this government let down the people of Queensland by not managing this world-renowned wilderness park. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024461"></A>
I am a member of a rural fire brigade and have fought many fires over many years in my own area. I have to say that the fire in Rockhampton was one of the hottest and the most dangerous I have seen in a long time. I am absolutely amazed that there was no loss of life or major loss of property. I think that really is a testament to those people who fought that fire. As I said before, I have great admiration for those who put their lives on the line to protect others. Rural firefighters are experts at fighting grass fires. Sadly, though, in most every case that I have seen this year their job has been compromised by bureaucratic intervention which has put their lives in danger and caused them to fight bushfires in backyards instead of fighting bushfires in open country and back-burning from prepared containment lines. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024463"></A>
The way to fight bushfires is with fire, to create break lines and to burn-back at night when the wind drops and the atmosphere cools. The new bureaucratic way to fight bushfires seems to be to wait until there is fire in the suburbs and fight it from there. This is a very dangerous practice and reflects some of the Victorian way of thinking that has proved so disastrous. My contention is to let rural firefighters do their job. Local people know their country and have fought similar fires before. They know the natural containment lines and the established firebreaks. Paid bureaucrats should be there to support and not hinder these volunteers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024465"></A>
It is typical of this government that it has to micro manage and control everything to the extent of not passing on fire levies collected by local governments to local brigades. In the local Rockhampton area a number of brigades have not yet received their yearly fire levies. I take umbrage with the minister this morning for attacking me when he in his role has not ensured that, after they have put their lives on the line, those volunteer fire brigades and volunteers have funds to continue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024466"></A>
Just imagine how those volunteers feel. They are good enough to put their lives at risk and take time off work--up to three weeks in some cases--yet they are not good enough or worthy enough to control the finances of their own brigades. I call on the Premier to sack those control focused bureaucrats and to get back to some common sense that provides some real support to these wonderful people--and not just give them the empty words that are so typical of this government, as we have heard from the minister this morning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024467"></A>
There are many other ways in which this government could bring common sense back into the area of fire management. We see a situation where Main Roads is reluctant to cool burn along the sides of roads and highways. There is basically four or five years of grass along the sides of the roads and it only takes one cigarette butt thrown out of a window and suddenly you have a fire five metres high heading for a boundary fence. It is about time that this government made sure that it actually did some real work in terms of managing the country that it controls--the national parks, the forestry and the wilderness areas and along main roads et cetera. It is about time that we saw some real initiatives from this government, got back to common sense and not put in place bureaucratic guidelines that are almost impossible for anybody to meet. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Chatsworth--ALP) (11.56 am): On 6 October the Clerk tabled the Court of Disputed Returns ruling on the challenge to the election result for the seat of Chatsworth. From the outset, I would like to acknowledge my colleagues in this House for their support over the six months. This support has come from both sides of the House, and I know that, regardless of our political persuasion, we can all understand how stressful it is to have an election result in dispute for such a long time. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024473"></A>
I would also like to place on the record that I respect everyone’s right to use whatever legal avenues are available to advance their cause or correct a perceived wrong. I do, however, feel that I need to correct on the public record the blatant campaign of misinformation that was conducted by Mr Michael Caltabiano and the LNP state office. This campaign started soon after the official declaration of the election result. Mrs Caltabiano arrived at my home and delivered court papers. Although I was not even named in these papers--Mrs Caltabiano was named as the applicant and the ECQ was named as the respondent--the Caltabianos had requested that the judge declare that I be personally responsible for their costs. This seems more like a case of retribution than a desire to see the democratic process upheld. Fortunately, this ludicrous request for costs was struck from the application after the first hearing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024476"></A>
On 15 April 2009, Mr Caltabiano appeared on the Madonna King program and made the following unsubstantiated statement--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024478"></A>
A lot of people witnessed very odd occurrences going in and out of polling booths, allegedly election people going in and out voting more than once, and of course we have the direct evidence of the absentee vote count on the day which is very, very strange compared to all other seats across the Queensland. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024480"></A>
Not only is this a direct attack on the voters in Chatsworth but this is also an attack on the professional men and women who work for the Electoral Commission of Queensland. I wish to address the statements made by Mr Caltabiano by comparing them with the facts provided to the Court of Disputed Returns. During the hearing Judge Atkinson noted, ‘The evidence being placed in the court of public opinion is not being matched by evidence presented in the Court of Disputed Returns.’ The truth is that none of the claims made by the LNP have been supported by one ounce of credible evidence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024484"></A>
Despite the claims made by Mr Caltabiano, the absentee vote in Chatsworth was entirely consistent with the results in every other electorate. Mr Caltabiano also alleges in various media and in a letter posted to all residents in Chatsworth that there was a deliberate campaign of multiple voting. The court in fact found that two people had voted twice. Both of those were elderly people who due to medical conditions were confused and made an honest mistake. Another claim was that questionable voting was undertaken by people not entitled to vote. Again, no evidence was presented. In fact, on day 1 of the hearing the LNP barrister, Mr PJ Dunning, agreed that there was no suggestion of fraud--simply that a number of clerical errors had occurred. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024512"></A>
The extent of these clerical errors was detailed in Justice Atkinson’s conclusion: two electors voted twice and 12 people were denied the opportunity to vote due to clerical errors. None of these 14 irregularities could have affected the outcome of the election, where the winning margin started at 74 and moved to 85 after disputed papers were assessed by the court. It is inevitable that human error will occur in any electoral process, no matter how carefully and competently it is conducted. This election was carefully and competently conducted by the ECQ. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024515"></A>
While I have stated that I respect the right of the LNP to challenge the result, I must put on the record my concern over the way that a number of my constituents were treated by the LNP. I was saddened to receive a number of phone calls from residents who were very distressed by the bullying behaviour of the LNP’s private investigator, who would arrive at people’s homes with preprepared affidavits and demand that they sign them. Two residents rang me in tears, and one was too afraid to go back to her own home as the LNP representative was waiting for her and she did not want to sign the affidavit. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024516"></A>
I was contacted by a local JP on behalf of another local resident who was being harassed to sign an affidavit. I was forced to ask the JP to contact the police on behalf of my constituent to ask them to protect her. These are not the actions of people interested in restoring faith in a democratic process but of people hell-bent on overturning a sound election result at any cost. When will they accept the facts? As recently as 23 September Mrs Caltabiano stated in the <Hansard-Italic>
South-East Advertiser</Hansard-Italic>
--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024519"></A>
At this time it seems as though the ruling says that all of those hundreds and hundreds of people that missed out on their vote don’t matter. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024520"></A>
The judge’s ruling makes it quite clear: 14 people were adversely affected by administrative errors. Mrs Caltabiano continues to mislead the electorate. It is now time for the Caltabianos to move on and respect the democratic process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024521"></A>
In conclusion, I would suggest that, far from building confidence in the electoral process, the actions of the LNP and the Caltabianos during and after the case were in fact an attack on democracy and the Electoral Commission. I intend to work as hard as I can to restore faith in the democratic system, and I can assure the residents that I will never put my own interests ahead of the interests and good governance of our community. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr DEMPSEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bundaberg--LNP) (12.01 pm): If anyone is curious why service delivery in Queensland is so appalling, they need look no further than the debacle over the A1GP involvement in this year’s SuperGP to find out why. The minister has absolutely failed to protect the interests of Queensland taxpayers and has misled parliament in an attempt to cover it up when the opposition raised these concerns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024526"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr REEVES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise to a point of order. I find the words of the member for Bundaberg offensive and I ask for them to be withdrawn. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024527"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEMPSEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw. The minister, his predecessors and the Premier were all very happy to take credit for the event, but not one of them has stopped to ask questions about whom they were dealing with. It is not good enough for the minister to now blame the comments by the A1GP as misleading Queenslanders when the government did not test those comments when they were made. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024528"></A>
How did we get to this situation in the first place? Rather than applying the proper due diligence when bringing the A1GP to the iconic Gold Coast motor race, the Premier and the minister simply took the word of Labor mate Terry Mackenroth, the head of the Gold Coast events company. According to the minister, the due diligence was done by race promoter IMG, but, as I was later told by him at a briefing, the due diligence investigation was for their purposes. I ask: what about the due diligence in relation to taxpayer funds? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024529"></A>
The government invested $11.6 million of taxpayers’ money on a hope and a prayer. It is scandalous that this could occur and the result is an absolute disgrace. It is what Sue Lappeman calls a shemozzle, or farce, debacle, catastrophe, disaster, fiasco, collapse, calamity and one last delightful word which I am unable to repeat in this House because I have respect for it, unlike the other side. I table her recent opinion piece on the debacle titled ‘Carnival blighted’. </Hansard-Body>

I would like to commend the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 for its support of this event despite its ups and downs and for its non-biased promotion of this event to the community, particularly to the Gold Coast and South-East Queensland. I attended the event. I would like to thank the many volunteers, the police who did an exceptional job and the local community for their patience. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024535"></A>
The end result is that this $11.6 million of taxpayers’ cash injected into the event has been jeopardised and tied up in controversy. We now know that the A1GP has a long record when it comes to financial troubles. The minister’s knight in shining armour, Tony Cochrane, said that everyone in the motor-racing industry knew about the financial problems. He said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024536"></A>
You get an enormous amount of feedback about A1 Grand Prix over the last year and none of it was good. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024538"></A>
But we had a minister of the Crown tell this parliament on no less than four occasions that it was all going great guns. Did the minister ask Tony Cochrane about the financial state of the A1GP? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024539"></A>
Last year the A1GP did not race in New South Wales because the New South Wales government did not believe that Sydney was getting sufficient international exposure from the event. The event’s New South Wales spokesman said that the A1GP did not provide an economic benefit to New South Wales worthy of paying them a sanction fee. The Queensland government, however, was very happy to sign up a lemon that even the blues rejected. Did the minister ask Events New South Wales about the financial state of the A1GP? Earlier this year the A1GP was unable to compete in New Zealand until New Zealand team principal Colin Giltrap put his hand in his own pocket to fly the cars out to Taupo. I table reports from New Zealand of Mr Giltrap’s further investment. </Hansard-Body>

It has been reported that the company held ownership of the racing cars. Did the minister ask the liquidator of the A1GP operations company about the financial statement of the A1GP? Also, the main company behind Tony Teixeira, Energem Resources Ltd, has been suspended from the London Stock Exchange for failure to file its 2008 financial statements. The statements are incomplete. </Hansard-Body>

 I hear a couple of members from the Gold Coast interjecting.

It is an absolute disgrace. There should be openness and transparency.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024550"></A>
These statements in relation to Energem are incomplete because the auditors have refused to sign off on the statements until the ability to recoup the $54 million loaned to the A1GP can be established. The loan is a big deal to Energem. Obviously this state government did not listen once again. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr CHOI</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Capalaba--ALP) (12.06 pm): Export is vital to the Queensland economy and to supporting jobs in our communities. According to preliminary figures for 2008-09, merchandise exports from the state were worth more than $56 billion, and the Queensland government is committed to supporting and building the state’s markets overseas. Trade Queensland’s Export Week for 2009, from 19 to 23 October, provided a strong reminder that exporting equals jobs right across Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024555"></A>
Queensland companies know that during tough economic times one of the best ways to protect and create jobs is through international trade. Export Week is held each year to promote the benefits of exporting for business, to highlight market opportunities overseas and to recognise the exporting efforts and successes of business. I attended a number of Export Week events. I spoke at the Tropical Expertise and International Development Business Seminar in Cairns on 19 October and, along with around 250 Queensland exporters, attended a export business breakfast on 20 October at the Sofitel Hotel here in Brisbane. Many more exporters and potential exporters came along afterwards for the export showcase. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024557"></A>
The Bligh government supports jobs and job creation by providing advice and assistance through Trade Queensland to Queensland’s existing and potential exporters to help them go global. That is what Export Week is all about. The Export Week program also includes seminars and activities focusing on business opportunities in Latin America, UK and Europe, Japan, Papua New Guinea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and China, India, Korea and the Middle East. Additional key events focused on Queensland relevant market sector opportunities in international education and training, sports business, mining equipment technology and services, clean technology and biotechnology. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024560"></A>
There were around 45 Export Week events in total--something for everyone. Trade Queensland--our export agency, with representation throughout Queensland and overseas in 16 locations--is an important investment by the Queensland government, which helps protect and create jobs for Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024600"></A>
This morning I would also like to pay tribute to Queensland’s great innovators and entrepreneurs of the export industry. NOJA Power Switchgear was announced last Wednesday as Queensland’s Exporter of the Year for 2008-09. This company’s increased export activity during 2008-09 created an extra 28 jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024603"></A>
In July 2008, Urban Art Projects employed 56 people. In July 2009, it employs over 80 staff because of international contracts. This company also won the arts and entertainment award at the Premier of Queensland’s Export Awards. Every job counts. Most of Trade Queensland’s clients are small- and medium-sized enterprises, almost half of which are from regional centres across the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024606"></A>
Another success story is a small innovative company Synforce based at Hervey Bay. It employs nine people in the production of 170 different premium grade petrol and diesel engine oils, automotive lubricants and fluids and industrial chemicals. This company earns a third of its income from exporting. I congratulate Synforce on winning the Premier of Queensland’s Export Award for an Emerging Exporter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024609"></A>
Recent Centre for International Economics data shows that one in seven Australian jobs are involved in the production of exports and one in five workers are employed in trade related activities. Exporting equals jobs. Our government is committed to encouraging and supporting Queensland businesses expand into the global market. The Bligh government supports the state’s exporters large and small, regional and metropolitan. Initiatives such as Export Week continue to help protect and create jobs for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024610"></A>
I also take the opportunity to thank all of our trade commissioners who work tirelessly for our exporters. Potential exporters often find overseas markets difficult, with barriers such as language, cultural differences, incompatible legal frameworks and alien business practices, just to name a few. More often than not our trade commissioners are the difference between success or failure, and I thank them for their service to Queensland. Once again, I congratulate all those involved in the success of 2009 Export Week events and the winners and nominees of the Export Week awards. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HOBBS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Warrego--LNP) (12.11 pm): I undertook another visit to the Torres Strait recently with the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Beaudesert, Mr Craig Batchelor, support staff, the hardworking Channel 10 crew and Cathy Border. I would like to report to the parliament on some of the issues raised with us on that trip. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1187967"></A>
The Torres Strait postcode, 4875, has the highest cost of living of any postcode in Australia. Unfortunately, the state Labor government is doing very little to change that position. The forced council amalgamations of the island councils has not been supported financially by the state government. Because of the high cost of travel and support functions of the new Torres Strait Island Regional Council little funding is available for the island communities to provide the necessary support and services. At least $14.8 million is required to enable council to roll out functions to achieve real outcomes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024619"></A>
Further funding is required to provide housing for employees, telecommunications and to upgrade assets. The Torres Shire Council is also under financial pressure and is struggling with the replacement and upgrading of assets and the provision of housing, public transport and economic development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024621"></A>
Sport and recreation officer funding and services have been changed and the Torres Shire Council is now in the embarrassing position of being able to open the new sports complex on Horn Island for public sessions for only three hours each Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Air travel has been thrown into chaos, with the main airport in the region at Horn Island urgently needing an upgrade. A minimum of $7 million is required. The state government has committed some money but it is not interested in helping find the balance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024624"></A>
The Torres Shire Council will unfairly have to provide substantial borrowings for the project. The people of Queensland and Australia need to understand that these wonderful people live at Australia’s front entrance, on our international border. It is a strategically important place for security, immigration, quarantine and commerce. This area needs more recognition and support not only given its strategic position but also given it is home to residents of Queensland who deserve a fair go. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024626"></A>
The Horn Island airport is essential to the region. Already QantasLink has stopped flying the Q400s. It has cut services back by three services a week and put the price up by $24 a seat. The result is that it is very hard to get a seat on the plane. Extra freight that used to come on the Q400s now comes by weekly barge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024628"></A>
The people of Brisbane, Cairns, Rockhampton or Townsville would not tolerate mail and freight only coming in once a week. The cost of freight is unbelievable. The cost to freight a bicycle wheel to Badu Island was $178. We could buy a whole bike on special for that price down here in Brisbane. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024630"></A>
 Why is it that Tasmanians enjoy a freight equalisation subsidy but the people of the Torres Strait do not? That subsidy has been extended to King Island and Flinders Island. The cost of fuel on Thursday Island is $2.10 and $3.25 on the outer islands. Warraber Island went three weeks without petrol. The cost of a 10 kilogram bag of rice is $36. A basket of 44 food items is $117 more in the Torres Strait than it is in Cairns. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024634"></A>
For too long this Labor government has taken the Indigenous vote for granted. It gives them nothing, only words. The local member has been missing in action. The luxury of Cairns and the warmth of his comrades in Brisbane is far more important than working for the people of the Torres Strait. It is no wonder these people are looking for a territory style government. Not only do they feel ignored, they have been ignored. The LNP has a real and genuine interest in improving the services and living standards of this region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024635"></A>
Time will limit the number of matters I can talk about. The Torres Strait is a beautiful place to live with a good tourist trade potential and growing commerce. However, it could be made much better. The state government can and must take action on a range of issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024637"></A>
On Saibai Island the backhoe has been broken down for two years. They cannot bury their rubbish and waste. It would cost $30,000 to freight it to have it repaired. It is probably beyond repair now. Waste is a big problem. The islands have limited space and are unable, due to quarantine issues, to remove the waste from the islands. Warraber Island has an innovative way to compact waste with shredded cardboard and other compressed waste. They should be congratulated for the work that they do. Great concerns exist with CDEP. When it runs out it will cost the regional council $8 million. </Hansard-Body>

Mr HOOLIHAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Keppel--ALP) (12.17 pm): When successive Labor governments took steps to modernise our rural fire brigade equipment by phasing out old appliances over 20 years of age we were criticised. Every step we took was criticised by successive shadow ministers. I ask members of the House when they last heard anything positive from the current shadow minister. </Hansard-Body>

After last week’s near disaster and the success of both urban and regional firies he had to turn on the Parks and Wildlife Service to blame it for the fires. I notice that today he turned on Main Roads. I wonder who will be next? I would draw his attention to page 13 of yesterday’s <Hansard-Italic>
Morning Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
. An SMS reads--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024646"></A>
PW, Rocky. Tell Malone, who is not the Member for Keppel, to stay in his own electorate and his leader not to try and get political mileage out of a catastrophe. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024647"></A>
That is about par for the course. Had he been there during the real emergency he would have noted that the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service staff were fighting alongside rural fire brigade members. They had carried out their management requirements in the face of substantial adversity as outlined by the minister today. But the fire started nonetheless. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024648"></A>
How about approximately 12 millimetres of rain in five months? Because of the very unusual atmospheric circumstances and relative humidity of three per cent, which is unheard of in Rockhampton during October, the Mount Archer fires did not act in the same way as many others. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024650"></A>
I spent as much time as possible in contact with the ICC, both the forward control centre and the major control centre, visited with the Minister for Emergency Services and Police, Neil Roberts, and parliamentary secretary Peta-Kaye Croft and continued my contact with many brigades from my electorate and all over Queensland. Our New South Wales cousins also helped, and for that we thank them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024651"></A>
Those glorious operators in their orange, green, yellow and other colour safety gear deserve every accolade they can get. The Premier thanked as many people as possible on Wednesday morning and viewed many properties which had come under threat. She spoke to residents, many of whom had helped firefighters. The front-line firefighters, including the airborne, were supported by directors in the ICC, police who kept the rubberneckers out of the way of appliances and police and SES personnel who directed traffic and supported residents. Businesses such as Supa IGA provided food and drink for the firefighters and the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024682"></A>
Bunnings also provided assistance to the Lakes Creek State School. The Salvation Army rehoused the family who were burnt out. Many other supporters ensured adequate food and support. The mechanics and the radio people kept the front line working. This effort was the community helping the community, which is the real essence of being Australian. </Hansard-Body>

I drove along Rockhampton-Emu Park Road at about 1 pm on Saturday and all was peaceful, with fires burning well away from any residences, in behind Nerimbra particularly. Four hours later, after a wind change and coupled with a less-than-typical summer’s day, this same residential area of Lakes Creek, Koongal and parts of Frenchville were in substantial danger. That situation continued further north in Frenchville later on Sunday afternoon. Then on Monday afternoon and evening and Tuesday morning, the fire burnt back along Rockhampton Yeppoon Road and threatened suburbs such as Hillside, Greenslopes and Frenchville. </Hansard-Body>

Fire is mankind’s friend and protector, but it is also our greatest foe. Last week’s fires occurred entirely in the Keppel electorate. Fire became an enemy that very nearly won. That it did not is testament to the hard and dedicated work of those people whom I have mentioned: the QFRS, EMQ, the police, the SES and the general community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024693"></A>
Both sides of politics need to give full support to our emergency management services, which include various departments, and not knock them unrelentingly for base political purposes. This was really ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Fires had burnt around Mount Morgan for some two weeks before they hit Rockhampton. Many people who worked in Rockhampton had in fact worked tirelessly. I spoke with a friend of mine who had been fighting fires for 23 days continuously and he is a self-employed businessman. As I said, this was an example of extraordinary things being done by ordinary people--a community that rose to look after each other. It is the essence of being Australian. I thank from the bottom of my heart every single person who went out and fought those fires and protected our community. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (12.22 pm): I wish to talk about two issues that I believe are important to members of parliament and the government. The first is a real concern that I have about the number of teachers we have in Queensland state schools who are in acting positions. This comment is not intended to be a criticism of our teachers who are working in acting positions or who are on contract, as I believe they all do the best they can under difficult circumstances. My concern is the continual change to these teachers’ positions and the significant disruptions that these changes cause to our schools. I believe that is not a desirable situation. This change causes significant disruption to student outcomes and I believe it impacts directly on students’ learning abilities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024697"></A>
 We now have flying squads flying in to try to improve student learning outcomes. I believe a much simpler and more effective solution to improving student outcomes in our state schools is to reduce the number of teachers in acting positions or in contract positions. I believe that we should change these teaching positions to, where possible, permanent appointments to enable teachers the opportunity to build more permanent teaching relationships with their students. All teachers refer to their students as ‘their’ students. They try hard, and they go above and beyond the call of duty to teach and encourage the students to learn, but sometimes they are restricted simply by the terms of their employment, because they are employed as contract teachers or because they are in acting positions because of departmental policies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024698"></A>
The other issue that I wish to share with members is the need for all state government departmental staff who make decisions about to whom they will award state government contracts to be seen to be acting fairly and openly in the calling of expressions of interest in the provision of state government services. When senior state government departmental officers selectively approach people to take over the provision of existing services, I believe that those departmental officers have a duty to notify the existing service provider that the department is not happy with their delivery of services and allow that existing operator to be involved and to tender when the department calls for expressions of interest to provide that service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024699"></A>
Government ministers talk about the openness and transparency of the decision-making process. This approach to awarding contracts should also apply to decisions made by senior departmental staff. I urge all ministers of the state government to take up this matter with their respective directors-general, to make inquiries about what decisions are made by senior departmental staff in the awarding of contracts and to simply ask the following questions: was the existing service provider notified that the departmental officers were not happy with the provision of the services; was the existing service provider invited to tender for the provision of those services; and, importantly, did a departmental officer selectively approach people in the private sector to put in a tender to provide a service? I hope that all departmental directors-general will ask these questions. It will be interesting to see the outcome of those inquiries. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr FINN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Yeerongpilly--ALP) (12.25 pm): No Queensland worker should leave home for work never to return home as a result of a workplace fatality. Every year, almost 100 Queensland workers die in workplace incidents--and that is almost 100 too many. Additionally, over 30,000 Queensland workers suffer a work related injury or disease each year, equating to an extraordinary 577 Queensland workers seriously injured each week, or 82 serious injuries in Queensland workplaces every day.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024703"></A>
While workplace injury statistics indicate a decline in the incidence of serious work related injuries, there is always more to be done. That is why this government is committed to continually promote safety in the workplace and to educate Queensland employers and workers about how to work safely. In particular, employers and workers in the manufacturing, transport and construction industries need to be focused on safety. It is those industries that respectively have the highest risk of injury, with the manufacturing sector of particular concern, where the risk of injury is almost twice that of the transport and storage sector, the sector with the second highest risk. Members will be aware of recent media attention on safety concerns in the transport and storage sector. Workers in the transport industry face specific challenges because, in many instances, their workplaces involve long-haul travel or working alongside busy roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024705"></A>
Earlier this year I attended a seminar organised by Workplace Health and Safety Queensland and leaders in the transport and storage industry to bring together employers and worker representatives to focus on how safety can be improved in the industry. Currently, Workplace Health and Safety Queensland is also coordinating a task force to address safety concerns posed by traffic controllers. Anyone following media reports on road injuries will know that these workers are at greatest risk of injury or death as they stand by often busy roads and are subject to the safe driving practices of motorists, including abiding by speed limits around roadworks. These are two examples of the work being done by Workplace Health and Safety Queensland to improve safety in the transport and storage sector. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024706"></A>
It should also be noted that approximately 5,100 of the 30,000 work related serious injuries and diseases involve young workers in the 15- to 24-year age bracket. This group needs to be a special focus of our workplace safety efforts. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024708"></A>
This week is Safe Work Australia Week and across Queensland activities will be conducted focusing on safety in workplaces and reducing the rates of serious injury. The primary goal of this week is to raise awareness of workplace safety issues and to promote and recognise those businesses, employers and workers who show innovation and commitment to workplace safety. Major events will kick off today, with Queensland’s first Work Safe and Return to Work expo at the Convention and Exhibition Centre. This expo has come about through a partnership of Workplace Health and Safety Queensland, the Electrical Safety Office, the Workers Compensation Regulatory Authority, along with WorkCover Queensland, the Australian Industry Group, the Queensland Council of Unions and the Association of Self Insured Employers of Queensland. The expo will showcase excellence in industry and enable participants to learn about the innovative safety efforts of businesses and people who are leading the way in safety practice, policy, implementation and innovation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024717"></A>
Tonight, as part of the expo, will be the announcement of the 2009 Work Safe and Return to Work Awards. It is important to recognise high achievement across a range of safety issues, but an important focus needs to be on return to work. While it will be difficult to eradicate injury in the workplace, excellence in rehabilitation and ensuring that workers can return to work with their health restored as quickly as possible is critical to best practice in our workplaces. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024718"></A>
Safe Work Australia Week goes further than recognising excellence; it delivers a program focusing on targeted safety issues. Today in Mackay there will be a rural field day, with safety ambassador Shane Webcke focusing on farm safety, which the minister spoke about this morning. Many members in this House will know that farms as workplaces can be quite unsafe, particularly when they involve the use of tractors or four-wheel motorbikes. Shane will be a great ambassador for safety in the farm as a workplace. Activities will also take place on the Sunshine Coast, the Gold Coast and other places around Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024720"></A>
With the alarming statistics of 30,000 Queenslanders sustaining an injury or illness every year and almost 100 Queenslanders dying at work, the target in Queensland workplaces must be zero harm. This government puts in a lot of effort, through Workplace Health and Safety Queensland, towards achieving zero harm. Delivering a safe, fair and just workplace relies on partnerships between government, business, workers, industry leaders and peak bodies to develop and implement best safety practices and, importantly, to help each other--competitors and colleagues alike--to deliver zero-harm strategies at their workplaces. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Callide--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.30 pm): The Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 is the eighth piece of legislation dealing with vegetation management that this government has introduced into this House since 1999. Eight pieces of legislation in less than 10 years about an issue that has at its heart a dependence on long-term decision making is an indication that for this government vegetation management is not about land management practices or preserving any environmental factors; it is simply a political opportunity that the Bligh Labor government grasps at every possible opportunity to advance its political cause. It has done it now on eight separate occasions in less than 10 years. Every time this government can see some political advantage in changing the vegetation management laws, it seizes the opportunity with both hands and introduces into this parliament another piece of legislation for its own political advantage.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024766"></A>
And so it is with the piece of legislation before the House this afternoon. The bill before the House this afternoon is about politics. It is not about trees, vegetation or saving anything. It is not about providing better environmental outcomes. It is not about providing better land management outcomes. It is about base politics. It is about a political opportunity for a failing government. It is about repaying a debt that the government incurred in the last election campaign when it believed that it was in trouble politically. There was a deal done for preferences in 10 seats that it believed it needed to win. The issue of vegetation management was considered to be completely expendable in achieving that preference deal.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024767"></A>
No-one should have been surprised by that, because since the original vegetation management legislation was introduced in this House in 1999 the changes that we have seen introduced progressively in the seven pieces of legislation that have followed that original legislation have all been politically motivated and have not been about science based land management. The changes have not been about addressing any established need; they have been about politics. I say very clearly to those people who might take an interest in this issue of vegetation management that they need to understand very clearly that the government’s agenda is a political one. It is not about producing the best outcome for Queensland’s landscapes or Queensland’s biodiversity. It is not about producing the best outcome for Queensland landholders. It is about giving the government an opportunity to stand up in this parliament, as the minister has already done, and make outrageous and untrue accusations about what we on this side of politics might do. It is about giving the reliable old political football another kick.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024768"></A>
The people in the great urban conglomerates of Queensland need to understand that Queensland land managers are, I believe, world leaders in managing the land that they are custodians of. I believe that the people of Queensland who do not have that close connection with the great land mass of Queensland can be confident that those Queenslanders who do want to manage that land in a very responsible way. Anyone who takes even a passing interest in land management practices across those broad areas of Queensland would have to be impressed by the level of professionalism and management that is applied to those great assets. It behoves the government to recognise the benefits of those men and women and the great advancements that have been made in land management over the years rather than continue to use this issue as a convenient political opportunity every time it gets into some sort of political fix.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024769"></A>
A responsible government would recognise the skills and abilities of landholders and the great store of intergenerational knowledge that has been accumulated by families who have managed areas of land for over 100 years in many cases. A responsible government would work with those people and provide the right incentives and assistance for those people to ensure that that level of land management continued to improve and continued to produce the outcomes that we all want to see, not least of whom the people who own and operate the land want to see because it is their core asset.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024770"></A>
At its very basis the philosophy that this government adopts towards land management is absolutely flawed. The government would have us believe that the rights and interests of people who manage the land that is their core asset--in a great many cases their only asset--need to be subjugated to the power of some faceless bureaucrat who has five minutes experience and no local knowledge or long-term interest in the management of those land areas. Of course that is a nonsense. The best people to manage those land areas are those very people whose futures and family’s futures depend upon them. Given the right tools, incentives and opportunities, I believe that those people have demonstrated that they are world leaders in managing landscapes such as are typical across Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024771"></A>
I have no doubt that we will hear in this debate, as we have heard in the seven debates that have preceded it in the last 10 years, the incredibly ridiculous accusations that the current minister and members like the well-known member for Cook over there like to make about Queensland land managers generally and about those of us on this side of the House who understand the intricacies and detail of this issue infinitely more than the members on that side of the House. I have no doubt we will hear all of those accusations again. But the people of Queensland should know that we support, as we have always and will always support, responsible land management. We support the preservation of high-value areas and we support the concept of sustainability as an essential part of land management. We support the property rights of those people who own land areas in Queensland. We support a legislative system that achieves the proper balance between the rights of those people who own and manage the land as their basic livelihood and the expectations of the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028293"></A>
We support achieving a proper balance in what is sometimes a difficult balance to achieve. We strongly support the concept that, where an individual’s rights have to come second to the expectations of a community, then the community must pay adequate compensation to the individual who forgoes the rights that they previously had for the benefit of the community. Since this vegetation management legislation was first introduced in 1999 we have constantly argued those concepts. We have constantly argued for the rights of the people who own and manage that land to be respected. We have constantly argued for their skills and abilities to be recognised and respected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028296"></A>
However, the legislation before the House this afternoon does not do that. It is politically based legislation. It is the result of a preference deal. It takes no account of the long-time scales that are involved in land management. It continues to destroy the confidence that land managers should have that they can take decisions for the long term. The decisions that are taken about land management and vegetation management are undoubtedly decisions for the long term. They are intergenerational decisions. Decisions that land managers take, in the main, will affect their children and their grandchildren as much as they will affect them. How then can they adequately make those decisions in a regulatory regime that has changed eight times in 10 years? That is the absurdity that members of the government fail to grasp every time they seek to bring a little bit more political advantage from the vegetation management issue. Eight times in 10 years they have changed the regulatory regime that manages an area where long-term decisions are essential. Yet as they introduced this legislation into the House it is obvious that they still have not recognised that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028297"></A>
We were told in 2006 that that had been recognised, that the legislation in 2006 drew a line in the sand, that it would provide the certainty that landholders needed; it would provide the certainty that was supposedly then recognised to be an essential part of achieving the sustainable outcomes that we all wanted to see. The 2006 legislation clearly differentiated between remnant vegetation and regrowth areas. At the core of the certainty that landholders were offered was that clear distinction that remnant vegetation would be protected to fulfil the expectations and the needs of the community and that the regrowth areas would be available for landholders to use as their productive land base. That was the line in the sand. It was the line in the sand that landholders accepted reluctantly because there was an enormous number of flaws in the defining regulations that identified remnant vegetation and defined regrowth. But landholders gritted their teeth, accepted that at least they would have some certainty following the passage of the 2006 legislation and, to their credit, they got on with it and they sought to work within that legislation. That was in 2006. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028303"></A>
Then the government found itself in political trouble in early 2009. All of the promises that were made in 2006 were thrown out the window for cheap political advantage. That clear line between remnant vegetation and regrowth vegetation suddenly was rubbed out. The assurances that were given to landholders that should have been the basis for them proceeding on a secure decision-making process were taken away for pure political advantage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028305"></A>
That is one of the great shames about this legislation. It is one of the great tragedies of the approach that this government has taken. I do not believe the confidence that landholders should have in making those decisions can ever be re-established. It can never be re-established. The example has been set. How can anyone expect landholders not to be fearful of another political deal at the next election? How can landholders ever be sure that the regulations will not continue to be changed? Of course they cannot be sure of that. They have to assume that the next time the Labor government finds itself in trouble there will be another political deal. They have to assume that the regulations will continue to change just as they have changed eight times in less than 10 years. Faced with that reality of a constantly changing regulatory system that continues to erode their management rights, landholders, unfortunately, I believe are forced to take decisions that they would not otherwise take. That is what the government does not understand. That is what backbenchers who come in here as some sort of a cheer squad do not understand. The meaningless rhetoric that they sprout in here actually produces outcomes that are the opposite of what they seek to achieve because they do not understand what they are doing, they do not understand what they are talking about and they do not listen and they do not respect the people who do understand these things. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028310"></A>
I have spoken at length about other vegetation management bills in this House and the extent to which they impinge on the basic concepts of civil liberties and the basic legal rights that we all take for granted in a whole range of other areas--legal protections that every Queensland citizen has. The vegetation management legislation since 1999 has been unique in the way that it has taken away the civil liberties and the legal protections from landholders. It has taken away the civil liberties and the legal protections that every other Queenslander takes for granted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028312"></A>
This piece of legislation is no different. Honourable members do not have to take my word for that. I would direct every member to the report that was tabled in this parliament this morning by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. I have read a lot of these reports over the years. I actually served on the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. I understand how they read through the muted language that the committee is forced to adopt when it reports to the parliament. The report that was tabled this morning by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee is scathing about this legislation. It is scathing not about what the legislation does in relation to the regulations about clearing but about how it meets basic legislative standards, how it complies with the Legislative Standards Act and what it does to civil liberties, legal rights and legal protections in a whole range of areas. Anybody with a passing interest in civil liberties or a passing interest in the legal protections that we all take for granted should read that report and be horrified. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028314"></A>
I want to direct members’ attention to the report in some detail. It looks at how this particular bill addresses fundamental legislative principles with regard to the rights and liberties of individuals. The <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert </Hansard-Italic>
states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028316"></A>
The committee notes that new sections ... of the Vegetation Management Act must be read with a number of other legislative provisions:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1028317"></A>
•	section 4.3.1(1) of the Integrated Planning Act (Carrying out assessable development without permit)--maximum penalty of 1665 penalty units ($166 500);</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1187949"></A>
•	schedule 8 (Assessable development and self-assessable development), part 1, table 4 (Operational works), item 1A (For clearing native vegetation on freehold land and indigenous land) or item 1B (For clearing native vegetation on leasehold land used for agriculture and grazing) ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028344"></A>
The committee goes on to make what I believe is an enormous understatement. It states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028348"></A>
Accordingly, liability for an offence is established by reference to quite a number of provisions contained within two Acts. This arrangement would make it difficult for an individual to establish the requirements of the law and/or liability for an offence. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028349"></A>
That is an enormous understatement, but the message that the committee has communicated to the parliament is a very real one. The whole process of vegetation management has now become so convoluted, complex and confused that landholders face the very real threat of inadvertently falling foul of the legislation. However, members who have watched the development of this legislation know that that is no excuse. Under this legislation it is no excuse to inadvertently commit an offence. It is a defence that can be argued everywhere else in our legal system, but not with regard to this legislation. The degree of confusion and detail is now such that the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee has raised very real concerns that I and other people have also raised when considering previous vegetation management legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028350"></A>
The committee has raises concerns about the administrative power that the legislation provides. It makes the point--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028352"></A>
... <Hansard-Italic>
Legislative Standards Act</Hansard-Italic>
 provides that whether legislation has sufficient regard to rights and liberties of individuals depends on whether ... the legislation makes rights and liberties, or obligations, dependent on administrative power only if the power is sufficiently defined and subject to appropriate review.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028353"></A>
Once again, in relation to the Vegetation Management Act that is a gross understatement. None of the administrative powers set out in the Vegetation Management Act and reinforced and added to by the bill before the House is sufficiently defined and none of them is subject to appropriate review.  Uniquely, this bill rules out that appropriate review. This bill is breathtaking in its lack of definition of those administrative powers. All of those powers are subjective. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028354"></A>
The bill before the House is code dependent, but we have not even seen the code. The bill before the House requires landholders to comply with a code that is assessed by the officer who gets out of the Toyota at the front gate. That is the sort of administrative power that is given to junior departmental officers who have had five minutes experience, and that administrative power is given over landholders who have over 100 years of accumulated intergenerational knowledge. This bill takes the administrative and regulatory power from those landholders and gives it to junior departmental officers acting in the name of the state. However, the power is not defined. Under this bill the officer assesses whether or not the code has been complied with, but we have not even seen the code. We do not know how prescriptive the code is. I know with certainty that the code will be able to be interpreted by a particular person’s individual philosophy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1028355"></A>
The committee goes on to talk about clause 32 of the bill. It states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028357"></A>
Clause 32 would confer the chief executive or administrative officer with significant administrative powers. New section 54A to 54C would replace existing section 55 of the <Hansard-Italic>
Vegetation Management Act r</Hansard-Italic>
egarding compliance notices. The new sections would confer powers to: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1028358"></A>
•	give a person a stop work notice if the official holds a reasonable belief that a person is committing a vegetation clearing offence (new section 54A);</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1028359"></A>
• 	give a person a restoration notice if the official holds a reasonable belief that, before or after the commencement of the legislation, a person has committed a vegetation clearing offence and the matter is capable of being rectified (new section 54B)... </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028360"></A>
The officer decides what needs to be done to rectify the offence that he or she decided had been committed. That is the sort of ill-defined power that this bill gives to individual officers. It allows them to make decisions that cannot be appealed or reviewed. It is a regulatory system that specifically rules out or takes away the right of appeal and review. The bill states that decisions cannot be appealed or reviewed under any act whatsoever. It takes away any check or balance in the system. Is it any wonder that the committee has expressed such concern? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028361"></A>
The committee states that the new sections would also confer powers to ‘use reasonable force and take any other reasonable action to stop a contravention’ that the officer feels is necessary. Once again, there is no check or balance; there is no right of appeal. The committee’s report states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028363"></A>
The terms ‘reasonable force’ and ‘other reasonable action’ used in new section 54C are not defined in the Act and there may be scope for the powers to be conferred to have significant impact upon rights and liberties of individuals. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1028364"></A>
The committee’s report goes on to outline a whole range of other issues. It states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028366"></A>
New section 68CB of the <Hansard-Italic>
Vegetation Management Act </Hansard-Italic>
would prevent a person exercising a right of review under the <Hansard-Italic>
Judicial Review Act 1991 </Hansard-Italic>
in relation to a decision regarding:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1028367"></A>
•	an application for a property map of assessable vegetation...; or</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1028368"></A>
•	certification or amendment of the regional ecosystem, remnant and regrowth vegetation maps by the chief executive.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1028369"></A>
Section 26 of the report states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028371"></A>
Where legislation purports to oust the inherent and statutory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to review the legality of decisions and actions, the committee considers carefully whether the legislation has sufficient regard to individual rights and liberties or obligations. Generally, the committee adopts the view that privative clauses should rarely be contemplated and even more rarely enacted. They represent a parliamentary attempt to deny the courts a central function of their judicial role, preventing courts pronouncing on the lawfulness of administrative action. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028372"></A>
That is what this bill does. It prevents the courts from pronouncing on the lawfulness of an administrative action, in most cases decided by a junior-level bureaucrat in a regulatory system that is open to interpretation, depending on the particular philosophy of that junior-level officer. It takes away completely the rights of landholders to appeal or challenge that decision. It takes away completely the rights of landholders to manage their own land. It gives those rights and that power to the state. In this case, those rights and powers are exercised by very junior officers of the state. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Before the lunch break I was referring to the report of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee and the scathing comments that the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee has made about the legislation before the House. Those comments relate to the gross failure of this legislation to meet any of the fundamental legislative principles, particularly in terms of preserving the rights and liberties of individuals, the subjective administrative power that the legislation grants without checks or balances, the powers to enter premises, the failure to protect people against self-incrimination and the retrospective operation of the legislation. The report goes on to talk about the provisions of the bill that allow for the compulsory acquisition of property without compensation. It also makes a very clear point about the bill not having sufficient regard to the institution of parliament insofar as when the bill becomes an act it can be amended other than by way of another act--that is, it can be amended by the minister. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037229"></A>
In the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee’s report I think there is reason for every member of this House to oppose this legislation. Irrespective of what the legislation deals with, it offends so many of the basic fundamental legislative principles that it should be opposed by every member of the House. It should certainly be opposed by any member of the House who has the smallest understanding of the legal principles involved. It certainly should be opposed by every member of the House who has even a passing interest in fairness, justice and civil liberties. I look forward to some of the members on the opposite side of the House who have spoken at length about those things opposing this legislation on the basis of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee’s report that was tabled in the House this morning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037230"></A>
I think that report should concern every member of the parliament. It is unfortunately though a continuation of an approach that has been taken to vegetation management legislation since 1999. The command and control and the regulate and prosecute approach has now become so convoluted and so complex that the only way the government can see it working is to strip away the legal rights and the normal administrative checks and balances in an attempt to make work a piece of legislation that as long ago as 1999 those of us who understood the situation were warning would never work. We knew that it certainly would never produce the outcomes that we all wanted to see. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037231"></A>
We should be introducing legislation that is based on science. This legislation is based on politics. We should be introducing legislation that respects landowners’ property rights and respects landowners’ knowledge of the land that they own. This legislation quite clearly--not on my say-so but on the say-so of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee, a bipartisan committee of this parliament--does not do that. We should be introducing legislation that conforms with the basic legislative standards. This legislation does not do that. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I invite the member for Brisbane Central, who seems to have an opinion on it, to read the report of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee and to stand in this place and explain how anyone can vote in favour of this legislation given the report of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee that has been tabled for the benefit of all members. We should be introducing legislation into this place that engages stakeholders in a positive way, that provides safeguards against extreme cases and that recognises the complexity of the landscapes and the ecosystems that it seeks to regulate. This legislation does none of that. It continues with the flawed approach to vegetation management that the government has pursued for political purposes since 1999. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037238"></A>
In terms of what the legislation itself does, it seeks to regulate the control of regrowth in an increasingly complex way. It provides for 50-metre buffers around watercourses in the so-called reef catchments. But how it seeks to regulate regrowth we still do not know because, as I said a moment ago, it is code dependent and the code has not been made available to us and the code has not been made available to stakeholders. The code itself is at the discretion of the minister and could involve anything. We wait with bated breath to see just what the code involves--the degree to which it is subject to interpretation and the degree to which it is restrictive. Until that code is available, the impact that this legislation may or may not have on the management of those areas in reality is something that we could only guess at. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037240"></A>
The issue that we have before the House is that this legislation is so open to interpretation, combined with an administrative system that has been deliberately stripped bare of all the normal legal checks and balances, that no member of the House should support it. It is bad legislation. It is the result of a government that has failed in terms of administration. There is no doubt that we will be opposing it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037241"></A>
I reiterate the point that I made at the beginning of the consideration of this legislation. In opposing this legislation, we want to see a system of vegetation management introduced into Queensland that recognises the landholders’ property rights, that recognises the great store of knowledge and ability that landholders have accumulated, and that ensures that we strike the right balance between protecting areas that need to be protected and achieving sustainable production from the areas that are available to be a productive base. But, most of all, what we have to achieve is a system in which landholders can have confidence--indeed all stakeholders can have confidence--and which provides security for those long-term decisions that are part and parcel of land management. Until those decisions can be made in a regulatory system that is secure and that people can have confidence in, we will not achieve the sustainable outcomes that everybody wants to see. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037244"></A>
There is no way that landholders can feel that confidence at the moment as they consider the implications of the eighth piece of legislation to pass through this House in less than 10 years. For the eighth time, the rules are being changed in response to a political need of the government. I think that the management of Queensland’s ecosystems and landscapes is much too important to be traded away in political deals. It is inexcusable for legislation to be generated by that sort of base politics at any time. It is even more inexcusable when the decisions that are involved have such far-reaching intergenerational consequences for the people who are affected by them. We will deal with some of the detail of the legislation in the consideration in detail stage. No doubt we will seek from the minister some explanations about how the particular codes will work and how the government sees this legislation providing any sort of positive outcome. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037246"></A>
Unfortunately, I do not believe it will. It is simply all about politics. We will certainly be opposing that legislation for that reason as well. In conclusion, I would urge all members to once again read in some detail the report of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. Read the comments that have been made by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. Understand the extent to which this legislation fails all of the basic fundamental legislative principles. Even if members do not take the time to understand the more complex issues of landscape management and regional ecosystem management, on the basis of that report alone there should not be a member in this House who has any qualms in opposing this legislation. We on this side of the House will certainly be doing that. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr JOHNSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gregory--LNP) (2.40 pm): I join with my colleague the member for Callide, the shadow minister for natural resources and energy, to oppose the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. It is a sad fact of life that in 2006 this very legislation was canvassed and thoroughly thrashed out by all facets of industry, government and all interested parties, but now it is brought back into this House in 2009. In March, on the eve of the state election, the Premier saw fit to appease the greenies. As the shadow minister has rightfully said today, this is about gaining votes through whatever measure possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040265"></A>
Central Queensland--the part of Queensland that I represent and the electorates of Callide, Warrego, Condamine, Mirani and Dalrymple--provides a very big area of food and fibre production for Queensland. What government of the world would single out its food producers for victimisation to gain political advantage? That is precisely what this legislation is about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040266"></A>
On Easter Tuesday this year in Clermont I went to a meeting on the vegetation management moratorium. The people at that meeting were young people. They are the future of our agricultural industries. They are farmers who are adopting world’s best practice through their fathers, mothers, grandfathers and grandmothers to be some of the best food producers of quality product in the world. I do not say it lightly today, and I urge government members to understand fully that these people have entered into large financial negotiations with their financial institutions to upgrade and manage their land in a way that gives them cutting-edge knowledge to be the best cattle producers, grain producers, horticulturists or whatever because they had that initiative given to them. That has been done by hard yards, by scientific studies and by an industry that has looked at the best processes in the world. But you cannot do anything if you are going to be strangled every time you move by a changing government direction and government policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040267"></A>
This legislation has been brought in for one reason, and that is to give this government the opportunity to put some of these marginal seats back in the hands of the Queensland Labor Party--to give them the numbers to win the last state election. That is history now. Let us move on and look at what this legislation is doing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040268"></A>
These people are the custodians of this land. They have proven their responsible management strategies over the last three years, since the last ordeal they were subjected to. Some of the developed areas in Central Queensland are experiencing uncertainty. I am looking forward to the minister making absolutely certain there are not going to be any deterrents there. When we look at the Redlands and the bayside areas, where there was all that magnificent farming land, through poor planning and a misunderstanding of how valuable that land is, we now see an urban sprawl. As we progress the development of this state, we witness areas of high productivity and high gain in the way of agriculture. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040269"></A>
In the early sixties, when the Brigalow Belt of Central Queensland was opened up, we saw the food bowl of Queensland again reignited through a visionary government that had the foresight to open up these vast expanses of brigalow land. Today we see some of the finest farming and cattle activities in Central Queensland. If you drive anywhere in that area from Clermont through to Emerald, Springsure, back in around Rolleston, up to Moura and back across to Blackwater, Duringa and then north, you will see some of the best cereal crops in the land. For dry land operations and for irrigated operations, it is all because of former governments having the initiative to develop.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040273"></A>
I note that the minister in his second reading speech said that where there are areas of concern with these development operations there may be a leniency clause in place where they can be allowed to clear some of this land. This is an area of high concern. Who is going to give that approval? I would be very surprised if anyone is giving that approval. I hope this does not happen, but I fear there is going to be a shutdown in some of these areas of the activities of some farming operations. If a place that is farming 5,000 or 6,000 acres of crop and running 1,000 head of cattle in conjunction cannot crop that 5,000 or 6,000 acres and can only crop 2,000 or 3,000 acres, and they have done extensive borrowing to improve the aggregation in question, before they know where they are they are going to be unviable. I urge the minister, his director-general and his departmental officers to keep a close watch on this to make absolutely certain that we are not going to render some of these good farming operations unviable because of this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040274"></A>
I believe that these people are very honest, very open and very responsible people. They are the ones who are managing these operations, and they are the ones who I know full well have cleared that land in the best interests of gaining the best production possible. I have witnessed in my own electorate over the last 20 years--and I am the first to say it--some land cleared in some of those range areas that should never have been cleared, and that is about land degradation and I do not support that. We talk about contour banks and making certain that we clear within a certain distance of some of these watercourses. These are the responsible management strategies that our farmers are adopting today for the long-term viability and productivity of this country. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040277"></A>
Central Queensland is now the food bowl of Queensland. It is fast moving away from the Darling Downs, because, unfortunately, in recent years the Darling Downs has been subjected to ongoing drought and has not had the productivity that we know it has had over the past 50 to 100 years. We need to have a food bowl to sustain the population, and this is where it is done. The first page of the explanatory notes states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040279"></A>
As a result of consultation, this Bill will protect mature regrowth vegetation that has not been cleared since 31 December 1989 on leasehold land for agricultural and grazing purposes, freehold land and indigenous land. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1040280"></A>
On page 3 the explanatory notes state that the policy objectives will be achieved by--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1040282"></A>
Repealing the <Hansard-Italic>
Vegetation Management (Regrowth Clearing Moratorium) Act 2009 </Hansard-Italic>
and providing for the long-term regulation of regrowth vegetation on agricultural and grazing leasehold land and non-urban freehold and indigenous land through a performance based compliance code. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043321"></A>
The member for Callide has today touched on compliance codes. We really do not know what the codes are. The codes specify the minimum clearing requirements that must be met and the voluntary best management practice criteria for landholders willing to apply a higher standard of regrowth vegetation management. I thought we exhausted all these issues in 2006. Over the last three years as I have travelled around my electorate I have not seen any violation of the management practices that have existed since 2006. This is an unfortunate situation and one that has created a lot of angst, a lot of heartache and a lot of concern for many people, and it is totally unwarranted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043323"></A>
I notice in the explanatory notes that it outlines who has been consulted. I do not see that the department of primary industries has been consulted at all. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1043325"></A>
The following State agencies were consulted during the preparation of the Bill: </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1043326"></A>
•	Department of the Premier and Cabinet </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

•	Queensland Transport</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

•	Department of Infrastructure and Planning </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043332"></A>
We have different names for these agencies now and a lot of people may be confused. The one department that stands out as not having been consulted is the Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries. They are the ones that oversee the growth, productivity and fruits of the labours of the people on the land. I think that issue needs to be addressed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043334"></A>
It appears to me that the legislation is an opportunity to run with the wind in the second half. The government is running with the wind in the second half. It had the ball in its court and it was kicking the ball with the wind in the second half as it approached the state election this year. That is what it did. It had a couple of runs on the board. </Hansard-Body>

 You are in front a long way because you did not play the game fairly. I take the interjection from the member for Southport and Minister for Tourism. I know that he is a bloke who understands what I am saying. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043337"></A>
When they went to the electorate they did not run the full time. They were six months out from the end of the game. They did that because they knew they were broke. They were on the bones of their backsides. We all knew that. I can tell by the looks on the faces of those opposite that that is right. Here they are now selling off all the productive assets of Queensland so that they can make a financial gain to perhaps pay a part of the interest bill on the $85 billion debt. It is a nice how do you do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043338"></A>
When you are not travelling too well you do not sell off the best businesses; you get rid of the worst ones and keep the most productive ones. That is how I would operate, but I may have it wrong. Those opposite may be able to deceive some of the people of Queensland, but the fact of the matter is that the people of Queensland know exactly what this is all about. </Hansard-Body>

 I hear the member for Bundamba taking an accolade there. It is about time that we saw some of the profits from the mineral boom come back into these regions where we need to build better roads so our farmers can get the grain and cattle out and be productive. We can then stop the bruising of cattle. We would then not have trains running to cart the bullocks to the market. </Hansard-Body>

Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is right. Remember what Gough Whitlam said in 1972--that great patriarch of the party of those opposite. He said that we do not need to grow any food in this country, we can import it all. The way we are going we will be importing it all right if those opposite continue with the shut-down policies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043346"></A>
This legislation has been written by bureaucrats. They are confusing the people on the land. They are not environmental vandals. The bureaucrats are the ones causing confusion. If anything, we will be making these people environmental vandals by not doing the right thing. Landholders will be directed by the bureaucrats, who will administer this act, in a dictatorial way and that will subject landholders to more stress than they need. Their directive will be ‘do as we say’. This is hardly the way to implement an act to initiate and develop outcomes for best farming practice for genuine fruitful outcomes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043350"></A>
The rights of landholders are and should be sacrosanct. These people are being pushed into a corner to capture the attention of the voters in key marginal seats. I think those in the Greens should know exactly what is going to happen to the food and fibre producers of this state and what they will be subjected to and the worries they will face as they are pushed overboard by their financial institutions because their bottom lines do not stack up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043351"></A>
These are all issues that we have to take into account. They are issues that will not go away. I thought in 2006 we had finished dealing with these issues. It seems that we have finished with them. All the scientific studies that have been done in the past have not been taken into account in this legislation. They were done prior to this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043352"></A>
As the member for Callide rightly said, legislation of this type has probably been back in this House eight or nine times during the last few years. I wonder how many more times it will come back? It will be the political football the next time those opposite need to get a few more runs so they can gain a few more seats in the south-east corner to again give them purpose to destroy the infrastructure of this state, to run down what infrastructure we have and to run up debt. I do not think it is funny. I see the minister has a grin on his face. We have a situation where people are very concerned about what is happening and what their rights will be. The minister stated in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1043355"></A>
If an agricultural enterprise is demonstrated to have become unviable because of these new protections, the director-general of the Department of Environment and Resource Management will be able to authorise the clearing of regrowth that would otherwise be protected to ameliorate the effect on the business. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043356"></A>
I think that is good. Will it ever be implemented? Will it be lip-service to these farmers or to the custodians of this land to shut them down for a moment or will this be a worthwhile part of this legislation? He further stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1043359"></A>
The second practical provision will allow some small and isolated areas of protected vegetation to be cleared if a larger area of unregulated regrowth is protected in exchange. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1043360"></A>
I think that is a fair comment. He states further--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1043362"></A>
Thirdly, and as I have already mentioned, the new protection is limited to regrowth that has not been cleared since the end of 1989. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043363"></A>
A lot of the good operators who have run very successful grazing and farming operations--and I am talking about some of those in the eastern end of my electorate and even the central part of the electorate--and managed their properties in a very professional way and have not had to enter into these activities since 1989 could be subject to a situation where some of their land could go back to regrowth. That disturbs and worries me greatly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043364"></A>
On many occasions people have to be able to put their hands on the money to undertake a management strategy. You do not start a bulldozer up for nothing given the price of fuel, the cost per hour and the waiting times. There are only certain times in the year they can do this type of work. With the moratorium some of these people have not been able to get on their land to put management structures in place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1043365"></A>
This situation is of grave concern to the LNP. What has the member for Callide said? He urged those on the government side to visit those areas of Queensland and see firsthand how responsible those farmers and graziers are; how they have gone about managing and looking after their land and how they use world’s best practice farming methods. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046602"></A>
At the same time, they produce the best cattle, the best sheep and the best wool as well as grain, horticulture and other products on that very valuable land in Central Queensland. Through the initiative of former governments we have seen irrigation schemes put in there. As a result, we have seen the cotton industry and other industries boom. Those former governments had that vision and created wealth and productivity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046603"></A>
I know that lately the minister has been out to Central Queensland and to the western areas of Queensland and spoken firsthand with farmers and graziers in relation to issues concerning his portfolio area. I hope he monitors closely any fallout from this legislation after it is enacted in a short while. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HOPPER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Condamine--LNP) (3.00 pm): We heard the shadow minister speak about a political agenda. That is exactly what this government is on about at this moment. That is exactly what this bill is about. Recently in Queensland we have seen an increase in the coverage of wild rivers legislation, we have seen the introduction of the Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Bill, we have seen the locking up of Moreton Bay and now we again have before this House vegetation management legislation. This bill is simply the result of a deal that was done so that the members opposite could have the majority in this House that they have today. This legislation is the fruit of the deal that was done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046607"></A>
For the past 200 years in this state we have had the sustainable management of agriculture. In 1999 the first vegetation management legislation was introduced into this parliament. For many weeks before that in <Hansard-Italic>
Country Life</Hansard-Italic>
 we saw the scaremongering that went on. That created the negative reaction of panic tree clearing. In the 12 months before that legislation was introduced, millions upon millions of acres were cleared. That legislation, the Vegetation Management Amendment Bill 2000--No. 35--was introduced on 24 August 2000. Leading up to the introduction of that legislation, the scaremongering and the mismanagement by the Beattie Labor government at that time saw a vast destruction of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046609"></A>
We heard the shadow minister and the member for Gregory speak about seven or eight pieces of legislation to do with vegetation management that have been introduced into this House. I can find 15 pieces of legislation that have been introduced since the year 2000 that deal with exactly the same issue in this bill that we are debating today. We have had the Vegetation Management Amendment Bill, introduced on 24 August, 2000; the Environmental Protection and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, introduced on 4 October 2000; the Natural Resources and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, introduced on 25 February 2003; the Integrated Planning and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, introduced in June 2003; and the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill, introduced on 18 March 2004. I could list them all day. There are 15. This legislation has had to come before this House 15 times. This morning I heard the member for Mirani say that the members opposite could not run a chook raffle. He is exactly right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046614"></A>
There has been no recognition of the responsible land management that has taken place--no recognition whatsoever. The LNP believes in compensation. Taking away someone’s right without paying for that right is theft. We have heard that before. I see the member for Toowoomba North nodding his head. I look forward to your contribution to the debate on this amending bill later. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOPPER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I look forward to hearing the comments of the member for Toowoomba North in his contribution to the debate on this amendment bill. To take something away without compensation is theft and, once again, that is what we are seeing in this bill before this House. The LNP believes strongly in compensation. It believes strongly in scientific evidence. We believe in being honest in the job that we do in this chamber. We do not do deals to put us back into government and then have to introduce legislation to sew up those deals. That is exactly what we are seeing here right now with this bill. We are seeing a deal that has put 12 seats in government hands. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOPPER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Listen to them squawk. They do not like to hear the truth. They do not like it that we are exposing the fact that this bill is part of a deal, that they sit opposite because of that deal and now that deal has to be put in place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046619"></A>
The LNP will not and does not support this legislation. This legislation is not about getting better environmental outcomes for Queensland and its many primary producers, which is what it is being portrayed as; it is about a preference deal with the Greens during the last election campaign. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046620"></A>
The code covers all regrowth not cleared prior to 31 December 1989--all 20-year-old and older regrowth. It will not cover the typical treatment of brigalow suckers. Therefore, the code will not include regrowth mapped using the following criteria: pre-1990, 11 per cent plus foliage projected cover based on 2006 regional ecosystem mapping data. The code will prevent the clearing of endangered regional ecosystems on freehold and grazing leasehold, of-concern regional ecosystems on leasehold, essential habitat for threatened species, slopes that can be eroded--greater than 12 per cent--and riparian areas and wetlands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046621"></A>
The code that this legislation will be based on has not yet been seen, which is of great concern to the LNP. It is also of great concern to the people who will be affected by this code. What the code asks of producers is still relatively unknown. Until that is known, any debate is premature. This is worrying to me as I read this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046622"></A>
The LNP is extremely disappointed that no job impact statement has been issued to accompany this legislation. So we are debating legislation introduced in this House without finding out what impost it will have on regional and rural Queensland. The LNP holds great concern for the bans on clearing regrowth adjacent to watercourses in the Great Barrier Reef catchments of the Burdekin, Mackay-Whitsundays and the Wet Tropics. The member for Hinchinbrook and the member for Burdekin will go into this issue in detail in their contributions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046623"></A>
The LNP supports the sustainability of primary producers and the management systems that they put in place to ensure that future generations are able to undertake a living from the land. We have farmers who are fifth and sixth generation farmers. If those people had been what you are portraying them to be, there is no way--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046624"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Order! The member will not use that word. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046625"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOPPER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Mr Deputy Speaker, I beg your pardon. My apology for using the word ‘you’. As I was saying, there are fifth and sixth generation farmers. They would not be on their properties now if they had gutted their properties, as they have been portrayed as doing. The LNP opposes the taking away of property rights from primary producers--the right of landholders to manage their own land and the right of landowners to defend themselves with no appeal option. The LNP is distressed about the rights and liberties being taken away from these landholders. The LNP is concerned about the self-assessable compliance code--the regrowth vegetation code--which sets minimum practice requirements. The code defines required outcomes and practices, which are termed minimum requirements, and outlines a recommended voluntary best management practice criteria. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046626"></A>
The LNP is very concerned that landholders will not require a permit to clear; however, they will need to give notice to the department of the location of clearing prior to the event. As the member for Gregory quite rightly explained, we have seen the fruits of the tree-clearing police. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1046627"></A>
The legislation has financial hardship provisions. However, they do not involve monetary compensation. Although the legislation will allow for the clearing of assessable regrowth, the following conditions will have to be met to satisfy financial hardship provisions. Firstly, it must render the business non-viable. So landowners have to say that they are not making any money whatsoever, that their business is not viable, and then the government will send out its people to have a look and assess the situation. Then the information goes back to satisfy the director-general that the business is an agricultural enterprise. Therefore, it has to be assessed that it is an agricultural enterprise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049863"></A>
Then they would have to provide sufficient evidence of financial hardship by way of a profit-and-loss statement. It is totally unacceptable to go into someone’s private lives to that extent to assess whether they can clear vegetation. Other conditions that have to be met to satisfy financial hardship involve the location and area of land that cannot be cleared and the proposed use of the land intending to be cleared. I agree with the condition in relation to the proposed use of the land intending to be cleared. That is about the only thing in all of that criteria that I can agree with.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049866"></A>
We have seen a whole heap of excuses being put in place to ratify this ludicrous legislation. Basically a primary producer has to be out the back door before clearing will be allowed. He has to be nearly totally broke to overcome the financial difficulties. The LNP’s policy ensures that landholders would be compensated for decisions affecting their property rights. A person has the right to own property. If something is taken away, there must be compensation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049867"></A>
Clearing that is not in compliance with the code will be subject to prosecution or restoration of the cleared area and clearing that is consistent with the code is exempt. The LNP supports protection and management of our land that enables the co-existence of both positive and environmental outcomes and food security use. The changes are not based on science. The LNP believes that vegetation management should be scientifically established to provide firm evidence of the outcomes. That is our whole, sole and basic belief. The LNP believes in scientific evidence. Queensland’s land vegetation and water resources must be managed sustainably. We believe that areas of high-conservation value should be protected. Once again, the Labor government has ignored the property rights of landholders which is of great concern to the LNP. The LNP had undertaken to further develop policy backed by science to ensure that incentive payments to landholders to protect their environment were adequate and not restrictive. We wanted to ensure that vegetation management assistance packages that are supplied are of adequate support to landholders. We wanted to ensure that the compliance with any legislation was conducted in a fair manner during the election campaign.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049868"></A>
The numbers I am about to put to the House are approximates only: the area affected is approximately a total of 3.6 million hectares--based on 20 years or older 11 per cent FPC 2006 regional ecosystem maps; approximately 800,000 hectares is endangered; approximately 1.2 million hectares is of concern; approximately 1.6 million hectares is not of concern; approximately 1.3 million hectares is listed as category X on the property maps of assessable vegetation management; and approximately 280,000 hectares of land is within 50 metres of the watercourse in priority reef catchments. A massive amount of Queensland is being locked up under this legislation. Our landholders are responsible managers of their land and are the best custodians to protect the environment they care for as they have been caring for this land for generations. The managers of considerable areas of land have been stripped of many rights over the long term of this Labor government. This is just another piece of legislation that is eroding those rights once again.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049869"></A>
How many jobs will be lost due to this legislation? There was no job impact statement done. Has the minister thought just how many jobs will go? The vegetation management code will be remade in one year with industry consultation. Remade to what and how much industry consultation will go on?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049870"></A>
This morning our shadow minister spoke about the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. In its report it notes--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1049872"></A>
Accordingly, liability for an offence is established by reference to quite a number of provisions contained within two acts. This arrangement would make it difficult for an individual to establish the requirements of the law and/or liability for an offence.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049873"></A>
Legislation is being put out that people do not understand. Perhaps the member for Toowoomba North, with all his legal background, would be able to explain that to the House in his speech. I look forward to hearing from the member for Toowoomba North. Another point that the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee brought up was--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1049875"></A>
The regrowth vegetation clearing provisions in the Bill will commence retrospectively from 8 October 2009, the day after the moratorium on regrowth vegetation clearing ends. The proposed Bill may adversely impact on the right to clear particular vegetation within the period between 8 October 2009 and the date of assent for the legislation. A person clearing particular vegetation in the retrospective period is not subject to criminal liability but may be given a restoration notice which may require the person to prepare and implement a restoration plan.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1049876"></A>
Failure to comply with the restoration notice attracts a penalty under the new provisions. Further, land that has been subject to a restoration notice will be shown as category A on a property map of assessable vegetation (PMAV) which means that the area will be subject to the greatest restrictions with regard to clearing under the amended VMA.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049877"></A>
We have here a whole heap of mixed up legislation that has been rushed through. When the maps first came out the town of Dalby was included. If people in that town mowed their lawn they were breaking the law. What sort of ludicrous law is being put before the House here today? I ask members to seriously consider this and realise the extent of the stupidity that is being put before the House.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.16 pm): I am delighted to speak to and support the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. I regret, however, the lack of leadership that is being shown by members of the LNP--old Nationals--who have indicated their opposition. It would be a marvellous thing if these senior members of the former National Party, members of the LNP now, were prepared to go out to western Queensland and show some leadership on this issue and say, ‘Look, this is good for Queensland. This is good for Australia.’ Peter Costello and John Howard often said it would enable Australia to meet its Kyoto targets. On the one hand those opposite are opposing this sort of legislation but on the other hand they are quite happy to be part of a coalition, and indeed a so-called united party, in relation to this issue federally. The hypocrisy is beyond belief.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049880"></A>
Reference was made to the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee report. The report of that highly respected committee is not all that different from comments it makes in relation to a large number of pieces of legislation that come before this House. The powers that it has said we should pay attention to are similar to powers in law enforcement legislation covering myriad topics that we see from time to time. We do not see the opposition opposing the police in this House in relation to the extension of powers to them, but the hypocrisy comes out when it is dealing with issues of vegetation management.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1049881"></A>
Another point I want to make by way of preliminary comment is the absence of former Liberal Party members on the speaking list. We have one member from Noosa who will speak. It will be a revelation to hear what he has to say and to see what principles he has jettisoned along the road. Before he speaks I urge him to quickly look up in <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 comments of former esteemed members of the Liberal Party who were prepared to stand up and support principles of worth in this place and to show leadership to their constituency, something that is not being done here today by the National Party. As I said, they say one thing here and a different thing in Canberra. It was only this morning that I heard on the news a report of a Senate committee indicating the grave effects of climate change in Australia, the rising sea levels and so on and the necessity for governments--state and federal--to take note of that fact.</Hansard-Body>

 The honourable member will have ample time to speak later on. In the context of climate change, rising sea levels and so on, we hear the same type of opposition still coming from members opposite that the honourable member for Callide, with due respect to him, made in his speeches when I first came here in 2001.

The honourable member for Condamine made reference to the fact that some farmers had been there for generations, and I acknowledge that point. I also want to acknowledge that most farmers, in my association with them at a personal level and from visiting out west, the centre of Queensland et cetera on numerous occasions, do manage their properties well. They want to make sure they have something worthwhile to pass on from generation to generation. Most farmers, in my experience, are indeed responsible. However, to assert that all farmers are perfect, respect their land and are not prepared to overwork it, denude it and all the rest is fanciful. Like everything else in life, there are good people and there are bad people; there are bad farmers. This sort of legislation is there to protect farms, farmers and the farmers’ income and that of their successors in years to come. For those reasons, I am delighted to support this legislation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs MILLER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bundamba--ALP) (3.21 pm): I rise to support the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. I would like to specifically address how the clearing of regrowth vegetation will be monitored and the refinement of compliance actions that will be introduced by this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053100"></A>
The new regrowth arrangements will require landholders to give the Department of Environment and Resource Management notification of their intention to clear regrowth. The department will monitor regrowth clearing using established remote sensing methods such as satellite imagery. This is a targeted form of monitoring which will allow the department to assess the effectiveness of the regrowth code. Having a record of the location of regrowth clearing will also assist the department in investigating reports of unauthorised clearing, giving it the ability to quickly determine that lawful clearing has, in fact, occurred. Where an offence is detected, the department has a range of enforcement options that can be used. This includes, firstly, a warning letter; secondly, an infringement notice; thirdly, a restoration notice to reinstate cleared vegetation; and, fourthly, prosecution through the courts. The choice, however, of the appropriate enforcement option depends on the severity and the type of the offence. Enforcement options were in place under the previous framework and will continue to be used in relation to unlawful clearing of regulated regrowth vegetation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053102"></A>
The bill also introduces some new compliance tools into the vegetation management framework. They include an ability to create a property map of assessable vegetation when the department has a reasonable belief that an offence has occurred. This is a simplified enforcement response for both the department and the affected landholder that will ensure appropriate protection of the vegetation. The property map of assessable vegetation will allow the area to be regulated and subject to assessment processes. Importantly, it ensures that landholders who act outside the law will not get unfair advantage to benefit from clearing compared to those who in fact do the right thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053105"></A>
Amendments to a restoration notice will allow a landholder to prepare their own restoration plan. This is very important. These restoration plans are necessary in circumstances where detailed management requirements are needed for restoring an area. The plan can be developed by the landholder using their personal knowledge and experience of their land and then approved by the department or, alternatively, a landholder can request the department to prepare the plan on their behalf. Such plans are binding on the landholder to restore vegetation unlawfully cleared. These new compliance tools allow the department to protect vegetation without requiring legal prosecutions. They also ensure financial benefits are not obtained as a result of unlawful behaviour. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr ELMES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Noosa--LNP) (3.25 pm): I rise to make a contribution to the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. This bill was introduced to the parliament following the state election in March 2009, and it was the first step in rewarding the green lobby for its preference support during that election campaign. This first green gift was followed up with a second one, the Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Bill 2009, passed during the last sitting of this House. At least some common sense prevailed in that case with the exclusion of dairying from the effects of that divisive legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053113"></A>
The common theme in both of these bills is that there are winners and there are losers, and it is a conscious decision by this Labor government that it be so. I should add at this point that there is no need for it to be this way. On election night in March an elated Premier announced as her defining mantra, ‘Queenslanders, you can count on me.’ The impression she tried to create was that she would govern for all Queenslanders and, like so much that comes from the Bligh government, the actions do not match the words. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053114"></A>
What irks me most about this approach, which I see too often from this government, is the total disregard for the rights of individuals. This is certainly very sad to see. I know and expect, as I hope all Queenslanders know and expect, that governments will always govern for all of the people or at least make a conscious effort to do so. The opposition will always stand side by side on behalf of individual Queenslanders and fight for their rights. We encourage self-reliance in the individual while Labor stifles the citizen in favour of the state. It is sad to contemplate this concept foreign to Australians, foreign to the Australian way of life and particularly foreign to people in rural Queensland. What we see all too often is this vindictive approach to governing. The rewards flow to favoured groups at the great expense of others. Labor’s actions say, ‘If you’re not with us, you’re against us.’ There is no room for independent thought, for an alternative viewpoint. It is ‘my way or the highway’ ideology. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053116"></A>
There is no room anymore within ‘Labor Inc.’ for public dissent. There are many individual points of view, for example on federal Labor’s emissions trading scheme, within Labor state rank and file, but neither those dissenting voices nor those constructive contributions to the public debate are ever heard. Labor discourages, stifles, disendorses and excommunicates any member who dares to speak up or speak out. This contrived unity of Labor contrasts sharply with the LNP approach, where the individual is strongly encouraged to research, to reach an informed position and to express it with passion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053117"></A>
The bill now before the House has a number of welcome attributes. The 20-year exemption is warmly welcomed. The self-assessable aspect is preferred to policing. The creation of new maps very quickly creates welcome certainty. It replaces the uncertainty arising from amendments and even more uncertainty arising from amendments to amendments of maps. These are very positive steps and they will be warmly applauded by us as they will be in the wider community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053118"></A>
However, the bill also has a number of serious flaws. It highlights a government which is already very tired just six months into this new term. Clearly, the minister has forgotten that the three-month moratorium created by the Vegetation Management (Regrowth Clearing Moratorium) Act 2009 was to end on 7 October. Maybe he was asleep on the job, as he was as Minister for Health. Maybe we are witnessing in the minister a new medical condition--chronic responsibility fatigue syndrome--and maybe it is contagious. As I look at the government benches opposite, I would have to say that it is. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053120"></A>
To cover up this failure, there was a flurry of activity as all of the resources of Parliamentary Counsel were diverted to rushing a bill into the House before the time expired. This flurry put at risk debates on other amendment bills before the House. It has risked proper parliamentary practice in order to protect the minister and this government. In my view, it breached the Legislative Standards Act by not adequately resourcing the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to enable it to fulfil its mandate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056583"></A>
If there had not been such undue haste, we may have seen a public benefit test and a competition impact statement. We may have seen a regulatory impact statement. We might have seen an economic impact statement. We may have even been presented with an objective analysis on the effect of the legislation on jobs. We are all the poorer for this lack of intellectual rigour being applied by the minister to his responsibilities. I am afraid that while we in this parliament are poorer in terms of our knowledge, the people directly affected by this legislation will be poorer in the pocket. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056586"></A>
The Legislative Standards Act 1992, at part 2, defines fundamental legislative principles. Section 4(3)(g) states, ‘does not adversely affect rights and liberties, or impose obligations, retrospectively’. There is no wriggle room there. The act does not permit retrospective legislation in certain circumstances. In fact, it bans it. Contrast that with the explanatory notes, which deal with this issue by suggesting, ‘In this instance, retrospectivity is justified.’ I am sorry, but it most certainly is not. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056590"></A>
The Legislative Standards Act states that one may not impose obligations retrospectively. The purported reason put forward in the explanatory notes states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1056592"></A>
The introduction of the regrowth vegetation regulations ahead of the legislation is necessary to ensure that high value regrowth vegetation and native vegetation adjacent to regrowth watercourses is not cleared pre-emptively while the Bill is considered by Parliament. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1056593"></A>
That is the purported reason. I suggest that there is some truth in the story that the minister and this government were not really up to the job. The government is prepared to disregard the aspirational law governing maintenance as the highest legislative standards. The notes go on--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1056595"></A>
While retrospective legislation which disadvantages individuals is a breach of fundamental legislative principles and generally objectionable it has been accepted that retrospectivity is justified where the interests of the public as a whole outweigh the interests of an individual. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1056596"></A>
However, the public interest is not the prime issue here. The prime interest here is to protect the minister. It is a mischief to cloud the real reason for the retrospective aspect of the legislation in a public interest argument. It debases the principles of public interest and diminishes the integrity of the parliament to permit this to occur. The minister should be sanctioned for this failure but instead the Bligh government closes ranks. It has done this before. It changed the law to protect a notorious ex-minister who at best mislead the parliament and is now before the courts. It is no wonder that the public at large is sceptical about the Premier’s integrity and accountability process when it witnesses such shameless self-interest on a regular basis. </Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056597"></A>
That same public is also sceptical about our future food needs. Mums and dads know the impact of prices on the purse. I go shopping regularly with my wife for our household grocery needs. The price of groceries and fresh food is rising relentlessly. GroceryWatch did not help us. Often on our shopping trips I see the amount of produce that is imported. If this government continues to maintain its relentless attacks on our farmers and primary industry, which is worth $13 billion per year to the state’s economy, then at some point we will need the income of a CEO, including some of those controversial bonuses, to be able to afford Australian produced food. Food is akin to electricity. In Queensland it is a race to see which will be the first to be priced out of the reach of the less fortunate in our society. We cannot import power so the price must simply rise and rise, despite all the promises--now so broken--to the contrary. This government has been asleep on the job when it comes to electricity pricing and it is now in great danger of much more than a nanonap when confronted with the issue of food security. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056600"></A>
Queensland has around 144 million hectares under food production as against the state’s total size of 173 million hectares. Over and over again what we are seeing from this government is a rush to lock more of our food producing areas away, with little or no compensation for those who own the land. At the same time, Queensland experiences a population growth of 1,500 people per week, as Australians seek a better and more relaxed lifestyle. At some point our ability to feed ourselves will come into question and this should never be the case. With the abundance of opportunities that this state has, it should not even be contemplated. Perhaps the minister will not be happy until all of our food is imported. Perhaps in time he will like his pineapples Brazilian. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056601"></A>
In the last sitting of parliament we saw the government’s attack on the productivity of agriculture in the wet and dry tropics. We saw legislation to specify optimum amounts of fertiliser; not best practice, but some arbitrary amount prescribed from George Street. We also saw the grazing equivalent to this flawed notion, which is stocking rates, until it was abandoned in favour of a regulation that we are yet to see. The impact common to this approach is a reduction in production. Farmers are trying to maximise the return on their investment by maximising the output from their land, without degrading their basic asset.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056602"></A>
If the population here in Queensland and across the world continues to grow at the present rate, how do we propose to feed those extra mouths? We need higher yields, greater areas of arable land or both. The logic is unchallengeable. Instead, we have a government that aims to reduce farm productivity consciously, that is locking up valuable farming land consciously, that is putting houses on valuable farming land near our capital cities and major centres consciously, and that proposes to flood rich arable farmland close to our capital city with a dam that no-one wants. No-one has been privy to the reasons for the proposed dam site being the preferred location. Not only is this land to be flooded, but also it is one of those lucky quirks of natural formation in Australia where the coincidence exists between arable land and adequate reliable rainfall. Water is life and the government consciously chooses to flood great farmland to prevent it growing food, which will diminish Queensland’s and Australia’s food security, simply to secure a few green preferences. How terribly desperate is that? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ELMES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes, it is Minister. A government governing for all Queenslanders should be looking for a win-win solution. How could it have secured a win for the environment and a win for agriculture? There is always plenty of stick in this government’s approach when dealing with other than its natural constituency, but precious little carrot and it is the same here. Where has the government sought to reward landowners for establishing 50-metre buffers around all watercourses in the wet and dry tropics? Nowhere! What will be gained by landowners from the legislation now before the House? Nothing! There will be nothing at all in it for them. What would encourage any landowner to lock up marginal land in regrowth vegetation? Again, nothing! There is nothing in this legislation or in the government’s thinking. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056608"></A>
The government’s expanse of moral rhetoric on climate change is far removed from any practical aspect. What could or should it have done to ensure that carbon credits were available to any landowner who locked up any land with vegetation? Now that there is genuine public interest, the government is notably absent on this issue, although I did note the statement made by the minister earlier yesterday or today. Federal Labor signed the Kyoto protocol as an act of faith with electors. Most saw it as a symbolic gesture aligning Australia with the rest of the world, so setting it apart from its major partner in many actions and causes, the United States. However, there were practical implications from that symbolic decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056611"></A>
Many landowners who recognised a niche opportunity to market their product as carbon neutral were thwarted at the stroke of the Rudd pen. Those who had planned for years to preserve and enhance native vegetation, surely the most appropriate vegetation of all on their land, were thwarted. Those who had their properties and production methods audited so as to be in a position to market their product as carbon neutral were thwarted. They found that the stroke of the Rudd pen had stricken their ambition, floundered their planning and made their niche market unattainable. Native vegetation is not yet recognised for carbon offsets. Native vegetation has no carbon offset value in the international climate change marketplace. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1056612"></A>
The inescapable irony is this: had landowners denuded their properties entirely of native vegetation and then planted an introduced species, they would be eligible for carbon offsets. Their trees would have climate change value. So the outcome we all want is defeated by a conscious policy decision. The outcome we want cannot be achieved by the present policy settings. The government’s objective is self defeating. The question is: what will this government do to align the policy settings to achieve our common objective? This is genuinely a matter in the public interest. As we are all citizens of the world, the challenges before the government are to represent all of us in attaining the best possible outcome. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060048"></A>
The government should revisit its policy objectives here and think through how this legislation will translate into actions on the ground. I challenge the government not to continue its vindictive approach to legislation but to look seriously at how it might work in the interests of all Queenslanders. I challenge the government to seek a win-win outcome which is not likely to be achieved as the bill presently stands.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060053"></A>
As I mentioned earlier, were landowners some time ago to have bulldozed their land, denuded it of native vegetation and then replanted introduced species they would now be eligible for carbon offsets. The legislation before us enables an exchange system which may allow some sections of protected regrowth to be cleared if replaced by another larger parcel. Will the government permit, even encourage, clearing of native vegetation for replacement by single species forests? Single species plantations are wastelands if the objective is to deliver a biodiverse ecosystem. So it seems self-evident that offsets must be recognised for native vegetation. If that is the case, then the government must pressure its federal Labor colleagues to seek at Copenhagen carbon offset recognition for native vegetation. It is essential that this comes about.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060055"></A>
We are all acutely aware in this House of the plight of the koala in South-East Queensland. Concerned citizens in great numbers demonstrated in the streets of Brisbane only a couple of weeks ago. The government’s winner/loser view was on display again when the planning outcome demonstrated that the placement of schools comes before the survival of koalas. With this legislation we have a great opportunity to extend native vegetation--vegetation with the highest biodiversity value--to offset the loss of vital koala habitat at Thornlands and elsewhere. I await, as a friend of the koala, for the government to announce that it will be using this bill to offset its own actions and demonstrate some leadership on this issue to the Queensland community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060057"></A>
Ken Henry, secretary to the federal Treasury, only last week on 22 October expressed personal pessimism at Australia’s ability to cope with projected population growth. He cited a number of examples where it was clear that we were yet to reach a genuine accommodation with our environment. He said that climate change would have profound implications for the pattern of human settlement. I share that concern and I challenge the government to address it--consciously. A Brisbane of four million people and an Australia of 35 million people by 2050 will create major challenges and major opportunities. It will challenge our commitment to sustainability. It will challenge our commitment as a society to the triple bottom line.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060058"></A>
If our existing settlement pattern is mirrored in this growth phase, then more intensive settlement on the coastal strip is as certain as death and taxes. It will mean heavier population density in our capital cities and in our major regional centres. It will mean high rises. It will certainly mean infill development, which the communities that I represent have argued strongly against as a shortcoming of the new Sustainable Planning Act. It will mean a sprawling of the urban footprint. It will mean a continual shrinking of the green buffers between the regional council areas on the Sunshine Coast. It will mean a continuing loss of food-producing land within the adequate reliable rainfall belt.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060061"></A>
The Mornington Peninsula in Victoria is a prime example of the transformation of land near a capital city from food producing to food consuming, as housing development has replaced orchards, dairy and cattle grazing. We are about to make a similar mistake by flooding the Mary Valley. It is about time that we began to learn from our mistakes. I challenge the government to think win-win, to adopt the most relevant of Steven Covey’s seven habits to this debate. But let us not forget, as we look to a sustainable future beyond a three-year election horizon, to begin with the end in mind.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Dr DOUGLAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gaven--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(3.43 pm): The Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is only just beginning to look like the bill it should have been from the beginning, but it is well short of the target. The minister has significantly toned down his hostility in the parliament to farmers by introducing this bill in the orderly cycle of bill discussion. Also, the bill itself is more properly focused on the concept of continual improvement while maintaining Australia’s reputation for a spectacular natural outback wilderness. This reputation has been earned with much heartache and passion in equal measure. Tragically, the bill falls far too short of what is required to ensure that the government too gets what it needs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060067"></A>
The key aspects of any regulation should be proposition, accountability, consistency, a targeted focus and transparency. Without including all of these aspects, no regulation will achieve the outcome it proposes to seek. Many of the previous bills on the subject have been based on winners and losers, and inherently this strategy often ends in failure. Members should not be blinded by emotional arguments that have no basis in scientific fact.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060068"></A>
I suspect the error of the government’s approach to date has been that it incorrectly linked a response to the demand from the Greens regarding preferences across the state in the last election. As such, the case for action in protecting the remnant vegetation was built around quantity and not a quality response. The government has failed to include sustainable farming and failed to carefully consider the capacity of the state, its officers and the economics of maintaining such an extensive land bank. In doing so, the bills that have followed have meandered along extreme paths in search of these critical ingredients in the case for action and the close examination of a suitable alternative.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060069"></A>
I say to honourable members that it really takes a lot of sweat, time and money to look after eight million hectares. When one is considering to add 2.4 million hectares to this register, the great fear is that we are looking at an enormous weed problem ahead. It is always far cheaper not only to get someone else to look after the land but also to pay them a small sum to ensure that they do it, and auditing them will ensure compliance--just as buying more and more land defeats all reasons that led to such a policy when the pressure of relating quantity over quality of land defeats the very purposes that some of the environmentally blinded believe rather than examining some of our national parks that are impossible to actually travel through due to weed and damage created by feral animals.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060070"></A>
I might give the humble example of a block of land in the Numinbah Valley that was purchased as a development offset to the Hinze Dam ‘wall raising stage 3’. This land was never going to be cleared, developed or used for grazing. It was poor land and remains so. These examples will be repeated many times over as the development offsets increasingly occur.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060072"></A>
The quality of the offset, just as the quality of the protected remnant vegetation, needs to be the centre of any policy that takes us forward in land management. What follows from that will be a substantial contribution to true environmental protection and a natural wilderness that will last into the future--our testament to the future. The bill is the eighth such bill in a continuing series of bills addressing the government response to what it believes is the responsible approach to conservation in Queensland. This bill is very much a watered down version and a far more tolerable revision of the earlier vegetation management bill, but it does not go far enough. It needs to go a lot further.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060073"></A>
The opposition is not supporting the bill. Although the LNP supports the protection and management of our land, the LNP supports a balance between the coexistence of both positive environmental outcomes and the food security test. The LNP maintains a consistent, honest and practical approach to land management. It is all very well for government speakers to pillory LNP speakers--I particularly heard the member for Toowoomba North--but, when it comes to eating food, I see no evidence from any of those individual government members that they are championing higher food prices, lower food quality and lower wages for their own constituents.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060075"></A>
This bill critically removes existing moratorium maps and replaces them with newer maps that are much more sensible and fairer to existing farmers and landholders. But, again, it does not go far enough. The minister in his second reading speech appears to reassure farmers by stating that ‘new and improved techniques have been used to match this regrowth to ensure the highest value vegetation is protected’. Fortunately, the government has heeded earlier LNP advice and taken the more sensible path of consultation with key stakeholders and the results are readily apparent. AgForce and farmers are more measured in their response. A key step to good regulatory practice is effective communication with all stakeholders at all stages of the regulatory cycle. This did not occur earlier and the reasons were overtly political. It was wrong. There are a few common misconceptions out there in popular thinking, including thoughts that farmers are not conservationists. They are our strongest conservationists. The reason is that if they do not conserve their treasured land they go broke.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063540"></A>
The next major misconception is that very technical and detailed vegetation management plans are the best way forward. I put it to members that there is compelling evidence that in areas where the government wants better outcomes by just paying the farmer without a sound farm management plan there would be a lot more borderline farm land that is conserved. More remnant vegetation is saved with a sound farm management plan. This step alone would save far more critical remnant vegetation than any other step. This is a major concern. If the government really wants to reduce carbon footprints, increase natural water flows, decrease artesian water consumption and retain all varieties of quality native remnant vegetation then it should pay the farmers not to farm or graze cattle, and all the government then has to do is manage the weeds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063543"></A>
The last point is a massive issue, because all this bill will do is increase the already massive density of both native and introduced weed species we have in Queensland. I mention the issue of carbon footprints because cattle have a significant carbon footprint relating to their food consumption and their methane production. There are reasonable studies which show the abolition of cattle grazing on marginal land is a very satisfactory method of running a carbon offset program, but is it a very satisfactory economic model? I would say that it is not. The only problem in doing so, if taken to its natural conclusion, is that there will be less meat protein to eat, less meat to export, and we will derive less foreign capital to drive our first-world economy forward. That is before we add in the health issue of encouraging the consumption of grass-fed--read ‘lean’--meat. This is what has kept the nation healthy until the fast food invasion of the last 20 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063545"></A>
Sometimes economics can lead to extreme forms of lunacy. What the LNP is really concerned about is that this bill will cut Queensland jobs and endanger Queensland’s ability to feed its population in the future. Instead, Queensland will become reliant primarily on imported food sources. Not only has this existing sensible approach maintained current agricultural production; when markets suddenly change, as they do, the producers have been flexible enough to deliver to the market what they wanted at an affordable price point. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063546"></A>
The previous bills were going to leave the most productive agricultural land in our glorious state quarantined and let go to weeds. In recent times we have all seen what happens when no land management occurs. Drought, floods, severe fire and feral animals can easily do all the rest and destroy pristine native areas that did co-exist with grazing by an astute farmer. The native animal losses and the permanent loss of native vegetation only compounds this dismal result. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063547"></A>
So what is the answer? Thankfully, the minister has taken on board some of what we were shouting at him. Critically, he has started with red-tape reduction. Specifically, he has introduced a new regrowth vegetation code. He states that the code has been written to make it clear what can and cannot be done. It groups leasehold and freehold and treats the protected vegetation on each in the same manner. Furthermore, clearing in accordance with the new vegetation code will exempt development and minimise administration and delays for landholders. He follows this up with an adoption of best management practice for landholders who would like to go above and beyond the minimum requirements--this encompasses weed control, trimming and encroachment--but in his following paragraph he includes burning to reduce fire loads and clearing fire breaks to protect infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063549"></A>
In theme with a focus of outcomes over process, this bill highlights that new protection is limited to regrowth that has not been cleared since the end of 1989. Because it has not been cleared for 20 years, it is more likely to be making a more significant contribution to the environmental health of Queensland and less likely to be critical to business viability. Again, there is the claim that there is a link between this policy directive and the Great Barrier Reef. The minister is drawing a very long bow. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063550"></A>
The critical approach of ensuring a factual approach to decision making seems, again, a difficult one. The appreciation of science is improving, but oh how slow it is. The government needs to consider the following critical facts. The value of Queensland’s primary industries for 2008-09 was $13 billion. In 2008-09 primary industry was Queensland’s second largest sector for exports. Queensland’s population is 4.4 million, according to the latest census, and it is predicted to increase by 15 per cent within five years. Agriculture contributed one-quarter of our state’s export income. Natural resources--largely coal--contributed $33 billion. Primary production has a higher value-add component than coal or any other commodities. The labour component in agriculture is higher than coal or, better phrased, there is a higher level of employment in primary industry than coal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063551"></A>
Historically, an upturn in agriculture tends to match commodity downturns in the market cycle. This is the big issue: the million hectares of additional protected vegetation is more than offset by the one million hectares of quality arable land freed up by the removal of areas covered by the former maps of the former moratorium. This is essential to ensure Queensland is more competitive, and it removes locked-up land from draconian legislation and restores equity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063552"></A>
Equity will be improved by fairer compensation to farmers for loss of land under the bill. Those with progressive farming plans are to be given a hardship provision, an ability to exchange small areas to allow for larger areas and to allow for larger areas of unregulated growth to be protected. The minister has agreed to make a commitment to remake the code within 12 months and in that time work with stakeholders to incorporate industry best management practice. I urge him to start on this immediately, but I see no real significant largesse from this Bligh Labor government in return for the farmers’ sacrifice to date--for what they have already lost and what they will lose in the future. It really does not make any sense to render these productive farmers unviable over the issue of land clearing, where it is the pursuit of quantity by the government and not quality. I endorse the comments of the members for Gregory, Callide and Condamine on the issue of viability of farmers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063553"></A>
Short of paying fair compensation, this is a better start than past attempts. If it was matched with an altered rhetoric that moves on from treating farmers as unworthy land destroyers to being worthy Queensland agricultural businesses, this would be acceptable evidence of continued improvement. Farmers are ageing. Few family members are replacing them, and they are an endangered species, too. We need to save them and nurture them. Farmers deserve equity and, as a minority, it is the Bligh Labor government’s responsibility to respond to these real needs at this time of their crisis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063554"></A>
As a GP, I must assure you that the health of farming families and their workers is directly related to their ability to retain hope. Labor is eroding their hope. It is taking it away and it has no right to do so. Interestingly, there is a change in the bill that all would be happy to see. It is the issue of the blatant land clearing with the future intention of using replanted stock for future income. This obviously relates to the incident that occurred in the Whitsundays. It does sound like a unique event. It seems the event will be difficult to repeat under changes proposed in the new bill. It appears contained within clause 46. The neatly worded drafting clearly states that the offending protected vegetation clearer will not be appropriately remunerated and enrich themselves as a result of committing an offence. This, too, is equity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063555"></A>
The bill does demonstrate features of some continued improvements, but the difficulty is that it is too strictly defined and the changes are much too minor to be of any significance. There are just too few of these changes that secure regulatory change and give farmers certainty. Again, it is certainty that farmers need relating to land when they are involved in the most massive speculative venture that any one group can ever hope to contemplate entertaining. Farmers have a right to that certainty, and it is inequitable to deny them that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063556"></A>
Equity also means that there should be reward for good practice and we should be harder on those who choose to do the opposite. Clearly the indications from the minister’s second reading speech in part would seem to say this, with statements ranging from a $2 million partnership regrowth program to prosecuting those who clearly engage in unauthorised clearing and compelling them to institute restitution. Fortunately, there is no retrospective criminal liability for the clearing of protected regrowth. Common sense is not always common, and fortunately farm economics does not seem to have made it on to the negotiating table on this occasion, and it really should have. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1063557"></A>
There are some other changes in the bill that have small elements that have great potential to create a great change for both the good and bad of our state. They are the removal of the right of appeal on the decision to approve regrowth and regional ecosystem maps. Fortunately, there is a right of review and appeal at the property level. The other change is the amendments to the vegetation offsets. It is said to be less onerous and more flexible. This is very critical. Since the mining companies are very much the major landholders and land purchasers affected by these changes, one needs to consider them very closely. For every strip of land purchased, they will buy another strip of land close by, generally. Currently these companies have engaged those properties in continuous agriculture and maintained those lands.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067078"></A>
The changes in the bill, if the water trading issue of several years ago is any sort of learning curve, will show that the purchase will be far further afield, the land quality much less and it will probably not be useful for mining. If they are able to purchase CO<Hansard-Subscript>
2</Hansard-Subscript>
 equivalent offsets these properties will be left fallow and not maintained. The proposed price of $10 per tonne for these CO<Hansard-Subscript>
2</Hansard-Subscript>
 equivalents may have sold us out far too cheaply and only magnified the worst of the vegetation management outcomes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067079"></A>
The final changes to the bill that the minister correctly addresses is the issue of beaches becoming private property and thereby restricting public access and the damage to the dunal areas that could occur. The change is very timely for the Gold Coast and particularly residents of my electorate of Gaven. As the population has increased and the demands for recreational space on our beaches increases, the maintenance of access is essential. Very critically, the shipping terminal that was proposed by the Beattie government but fortunately cancelled by the incoming Bligh Labor government basically assured that that land is available for the public. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067080"></A>
The maintenance of access is absolutely critical. Thousands of Gaven voters saved those lands for their use as beach. They want public access. Primarily it is at The Spit, but there are many other areas. It is indeed appropriate for the state to control the registration of survey plans with a tidal boundary. The government must not abuse the privilege. With recent changes to the Sustainable Planning Act, critically ministerial call-ins, the public will be watching very closely the actions of the government and its lobbyist cronies as the sea change set seek more exclusive use of beachfront land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067082"></A>
Just as it is critical to listen to what the Labor government says, it is more important to see what it actually does in practice. The approach of the bill has been poorly inclusive of the concept of sustainable farming. It remains far too heavily weighted on appealing to the extreme view of saving anything it can get rather than targeting quality over quantity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067083"></A>
I believe the lessons from the expensive maintenance of national park land and state forests have not been seen in this bill. It has been a rush for quantity when a more targeted approach was called for. I think this is a better version than version 7 but I look forward very much to version 9. I presume it will come along pretty soon. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067084"></A>
Farmers over many years have known that land selection is critically important, and it remains so. The problems facing governments are not really so dissimilar to those facing farmers. Interestingly, when parties have a joint mutual gain and by default mutual loss they tend to not only closely understand each other but their mutual failure or success is either jointly assured or lost as it turns out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067085"></A>
This embraces the virtue of good governance where the option that generates the greater net benefit to the community is usually the best option. It is always the most cost effective. We are travelling on the same boat but there are very many different personalities. We need to appreciate their flaws and forgive them for their perceived past mistakes, pursue quality over quantity and remember what we learned as children that more is not necessarily better. Rather than me call government members names and in response they retort in kind, honourable members, when one is prepared to not only listen to but to understand a minority group’s need for equity, do not always assume that your problem will be abolished by abolishing their’s. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.03 pm): I rise to make a small contribution to the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. Really this bill should be called the preference deal bill more so than the vegetation management bill. It would be much more appropriate. This is not about land management; it is about shoring up preference deals with the Greens. That is really what this bill is about. I will go through some examples. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067089"></A>
The shadow minister, the member for Callide, mentioned the <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert</Hansard-Italic>
 that was tabled by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee this morning. This legislation has that many holes in it that it is deplorable. It is disappointing that this sort of legislation is drafted. It has Henry VIII clauses in it. It is a terrible piece of legislation. Dot point 26 of the <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert </Hansard-Italic>
states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067091"></A>
Where legislation purports to oust the inherent and statutory jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to review the legality of decisions and actions, the committee considers carefully whether the legislation has sufficient regard to individual rights and liberties or obligations. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067093"></A>
This goes right through the whole bill. These landholders are really looking after the assets of Queensland. Some of them have been doing so for generations. It is about land management of core assets. It should be about doing what the landholders know best. As the shadow minister said, this legislation has been before the House eight times in 10 years. Every time this government gets into a bit of trouble it runs out a vegetation management and other legislation amendment bill to try to shore up its preferences to make sure it gets the right votes. That is what it is really about. This bill is saying that the bureaucrats have the knowledge and not the landholders. This is a very poor piece of legislation. Property rights are thrown out the door. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067097"></A>
I visited a landholder on my way down to parliament this week. They have 250 acres of land at Mutdapilly which is on the outskirts of Ipswich. This is the Stokes property. The family has had the land in their care for almost 70 years. I think it was in 1941 that Ellen Stokes and her husband bought the land. They have looked after it. They have managed it well. It is ridge country that has a lot of ironbark timber on it. They have used it as a timber block so they have taken timber off it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067101"></A>
It is actually divided into two blocks. One is 52.08 hectares and the other is 65.62 hectares. The whole property is coloured on the maps. The whole property is either endangered or needs preserving. They are virtually limited in terms of what they can do on the whole block. There are two pieces of land that have been cleared and that they are allowed to use appropriately. They are virtually tied up. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067103"></A>
Robin and Wendy Stokes are now the owners. Mrs Stokes passed away recently aged about 101. She had the paperwork in 1999 and did nothing with it. She was in her 90s then. She did very little with the paperwork. As far as she was concerned, it was her land and she would do what she liked with it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067104"></A>
Robin and Wendy Stokes took over the land just recently. The whole property is coloured on the maps. That is how well they have looked after this land. The whole lot is coloured. When the neighbours were clearing their land and were not doing quite as good a job of managing their land, Mr Stokes said, ‘Why would you do that?’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067105"></A>
He has one of the biggest blocks in the area. It is 250 acres. The whole lot has been well looked after and well managed. They are penalised because of that. They have had about four sale contracts on the land and they have all fallen through because of the issues surrounding the Vegetation Management Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067106"></A>
This government has done a poor job of explaining what people can do. No-one seems to understand what they can do. The real estate agents do not understand it. The purchasers do not understand it. The owners do not understand it. That is how poor the explanation has been of the Vegetation Management Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067107"></A>
How could they understand it? We have had eight bills in 10 years. The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee says that people have to look at other acts as well to understand this act. There are two other acts mentioned in the provisions related to the penalties. The way this has been managed is inappropriate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067108"></A>
I heard through scuttlebutt that the minister is interested in land around Boonah. If he ever wants to have a look at how this block of land has been managed I am more than happy to take him down there and show him this block of land. It is 250 acres. There are two big parcels of over 100 acres each. It has been really well looked after. The owners are virtually being penalised because of it. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr RICKUSS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, this is Mutdapilly. This is actually in Lockyer, not in Ipswich West. I think the minister is looking in the member for Beaudesert’s area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067141"></A>
So, really, these are unfortunate ramifications for landholders. The minister must explain to landholders what this eighth vegetation management legislation in 10 years actually means. Recently in the Lockyer I had a meeting with landholders on the escarpment of the Toowoomba range about firebreaks. I had that meeting because a lot of the landholders did not really know what they could do and what they could not do. Nowadays, it is about as clear as mud what landholders can do. Landholders do not understand that they can clear land in some places and legally put in firebreaks. But this legislation just walks over a person’s civil liberties and their legal rights. It is difficult for landholders to understand the law in this legislation. It is very poor legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067142"></A>
I notice in the minister’s second reading speech he stated that there were no permits required and that landholders just have to give notice of land clearing. I think that issue needs to be put out there so that landholders understand what is going on. I really do not think they realise that. The minister then stated further in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067144"></A>
If an agricultural enterprise is demonstrated to have become unviable because of these new protections, the director-general of the Department of Environment and Resource Management will be able to authorise the clearing of regrowth that would otherwise be protected to ameliorate the effect on the business.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067145"></A>
How can that authorisation be applied for? Will there be a standard set of procedures for that, or will that authorisation be at the discretion of the director-general? What guidelines will be placed around that authorisation? This is really important for people who are in financial difficulties.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067146"></A>
There are some workplace health and safety issues involved in this regrowth for ringers and other people who try to manage these areas for cattle. For example, with this block that I looked at at Mutdapilly, you would be flat out riding a motorbike or a horse through there trying to round up cattle. It would be really dangerous work. I think the minister needs to be clear on how people can manage that regrowth so that the safety of workers is not endangered through the management of this country. It is really important that some of these questions be answered.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067147"></A>
I also want to know from the minister when landholders will have to submit an application if they do not agree with their maps. I do not see that in the legislation. If they disagree with the mapping, is there going to be a time limit on how long they have in which to submit a PMAV application? I think these issues have to be made public so that the public understands them. I notice that the minister also said the following in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1067149"></A>
I have made a commitment to remake the code within 12 months and in that time to work with stakeholders to incorporate industry best management practices.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067150"></A>
Even the explanatory notes state that the government has consulted. But it did not consult with any of the stakeholders, apparently. It was only after the announcement was made that there was any consultation. I find that very disappointing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067151"></A>
The minister also stated in his second reading speech that the government has allocated $2 million to deliver the new regrowth measurements in partnership with stakeholders. How is that funding going to be delivered? How can people apply to get some of those funds? If that funding is to be given to landholders, what are the arrangements to make that funding available for them? What is involved in that funding of $2 million? I think we need an answer to those questions as well. The minister’s second reading speech also states that if a landholder disagrees with the mapping the bill provides a right of review and a right of appeal on the merits of the decision of the property level. All of that information must be put out to landholders. At the moment, landholders are unaware of what is available to them, what they can do and what they cannot do.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067152"></A>
As I said before, I spoke to landholders at Mutdapilly, which is less than an hour’s drive from here. Those people do not have an idea of what they can do and what they cannot do. The real estate people who are involved in trying to sell land there do not have any idea of what potential owners of the land can do. So the lack of information that has been put out to the public is really disappointing. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WENDT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich West--ALP) (4.14 pm): In rising to participate in the debate on the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009, I would like to address those provisions that I believe seek to streamline the vegetation management framework and then comment on the subsequent benefits that those reforms will bring to landholders. It is considered that, through simplifying the administration of the legislation and providing clearer decision-making processes, these changes will improve the operation of the framework, thereby making it easier for landholders to understand and apply it. The changes mooted also include a tidy-up of provisions to make the language used more straightforward and at the same time also make administrative procedures easier for landholders and the government. In addition, it is important to note that a new review and appeal process will be provided where none previously existed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067156"></A>
The state’s vegetation management framework is delivered through the Vegetation Management Act and regulation, relevant parts of the Integrated Planning Act and regulation and, of course, the various codes and policies. As such, the proposed changes to streamline the operation of the legislation have been derived from the review of the implementation of the Vegetation Management Act 1999, which, of course, was a commitment of the Blueprint for the Bush initiative. The participants involved in that review identified areas where the administration of the legislation could be improved, such as the simplification of vegetation mapping and the clarification of processes related to vegetation clearing applications. With that in mind, in terms of improvement to mapping, this bill makes amendments seeking to streamline mapping arrangements within the Department of Environment and Resource Management and, in doing so, it provides a single process for finetuning and amending vegetation management maps at a property scale via a PMAV application.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067160"></A>
These amendments will also create a new section in the Vegetation Management Act that describes each vegetation map in a uniform structure that sets out clearly what each map contains and how it is approved. Further, this bill changes definitions related to the class of each regional ecosystem--that is, endangered, of concern and of least concern--to be clearer so that the colours on the map provide guidance in determining class but do not set that in law.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067161"></A>
In addition, this bill will also provide new details on the various vegetation management codes and policies. Five years of implementation of vegetation management codes and policies has led to the evolution of these policies to better provide for special circumstances, such as projects of significant community benefit. Further, this bill also provides a new penalty associated with the existing requirement for a person who undertakes a forest practice to give the department notice of that activity. That makes the forest practice code consistent with the new and similar requirement to give notice when clearing regrowth under the regrowth code. Of course, this amendment provides that there are consequences for not complying with this requirement, which can be a fine of up to $5,000 at the discretion of the Magistrates Court.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067162"></A>
 I would also like to highlight amendments that change the terminology of ‘not of concern regional ecosystem’ to ‘least concern regional ecosystem’. I am advised that the desirability for this amendment arose from feedback from clients that indicated that the term was confusing and that misunderstandings may lead to inadvertent and unlawful clearing. As we know, the term is part of the hierarchy of regional ecosystem conservation classes, that is, endangered, of concern and not of concern. However, the term ‘not of concern’ is not intended to imply that this class of regional ecosystems is not considered valuable by the state or, for that matter, the community. It is my belief that this amendment will not affect the on-ground status of vegetation or how clearing applications are assessed, but it helps landholders better understand the vegetation management requirements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067163"></A>
On another issue, this bill will introduce a new internal review process for particular decisions made under the Vegetation Management Act, including decisions about PMAVs. That means that a person dissatisfied with the result of the internal review can apply for the decision to be reviewed externally or by the new Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal. I firmly believe that QCAT, which commences on 1 December 2009, will be an economical, informal and efficient gateway for community access to justice. I consider that these measures in the bill will increase the transparency of decisions and potentially reduce applicants’ appeal costs, which, of course, is very important.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1067165"></A>
Finally, this bill also provides a range of minor and consequential amendments--essentially housekeeping or tidying-up amendments--that are necessary, principally to iron out differences that have crept into the Vegetation Management Act, the Integrated Planning Act and other legislation over time. In conclusion, I feel that the proposed amendments highlighted in this bill will make vegetation management processes more efficient for landowners while ensuring the purpose of the Vegetation Management Act is achieved. As such, I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.20 pm): It is a great pleasure to rise to speak in favour of the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill before the House this afternoon, an afternoon where we have heard the usual arguments and the denial of the science from those opposite. Every time we bring an environmental bill into this House to try to improve the environment of this state it is as sure as night follows day that those opposite will oppose it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070929"></A>
Why will they not understand that the human impact on this planet has had a profound effect, particularly in the last 200 years, and we as a generation must take steps to address the changes in the environment that have occurred during that time? Why is it that every time we try to take positive steps to improve the environment in this state those opposite refuse to support and to take action?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070930"></A>
It is a great shame that the member for Dalrymple is not on the speakers list this afternoon. I am not sure if he is in the House today. I really would have appreciated hearing the contribution of the member for Dalrymple, as I am sure the minister would have. The member for Dalrymple and I share quite a long boundary. Part of it is the boundary along the Walsh River just near a small town called Dimbulah just outside of Mareeba in Far North Queensland. Along the boundary between Dalrymple and Cook is a group of farmers who are desperately trying to protect riparian regrowth along the Walsh River that separates the electorate of Dalrymple from mine. That particular piece of regrowth along this riparian area is under threat from sand mining. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070931"></A>
An application has been taken to extract sand from the Walsh River. Farmers there are completely incensed that this application is being made and they are totally opposed to it. They have set up a fighting fund, they have put petitions before this parliament and they are lobbying the minister, the department and the director-general to make sure that this riparian area is protected because they understand the importance of it. They will not rest until this important area is protected. They feel great ownership of this riparian area and want to protect it. They have come to me, and I would be interested to know if they have been to the member for Dalrymple, to see if they can invoke this legislation to protect this particular area of regrowth vegetation along the Walsh River. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070932"></A>
The member for Dalrymple is on the public record saying that he supports these farmers in their efforts to protect this particular piece of regrowth vegetation, as am I. We support these farmers in what they are trying to do to protect this area. It is a beautiful area. It is all regrowth area, that is true, but it is a beautiful area. It is a fantastic place for wildlife, freshwater crocodiles and fishing. It is an important area for that community and their recreational activities. We want to see it protected--I want to see it protected; the member for Dalrymple wants to see it protected. We have here a mechanism, if it was in place when these applications were made, that would have protected that piece of vegetation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070933"></A>
I am disappointed that the member for Dalrymple is not speaking today, because he could have put on record his support for this legislation that would have helped his constituents who are so desperately trying to protect that piece of vegetation that separates his electorate from mine. I understand that farmers value and want protected these important areas. This legislation will assist them to do that. I have farmers in my electorate, like those in the Dimbulah area, who are fighting tooth and nail to protect their regrowth vegetation. I think we should support them, and support them by supporting the bill that is before the House. There are other areas just like the Walsh River that are in need of protection and that require the support of this House. There is only one way for us to do it and that is to act through legislation. I think most farmers do want these areas protected and understand the value of these areas, like the farmers in the Walsh River do, and I certainly put my support behind them in their efforts to protect that particular area. I only wish that the member for Dalrymple would do the same.<Hansard-Speech-End>

(4.25 pm): I was very interested to hear the member for Cook talk about the member for Dalrymple when he was not here. He mentioned him on many occasions. That is the sort of attitude that we have here. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

Mr HOBBS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
He may not be here in the parliament for various reasons. Maybe there has been a sickness in the family; maybe he has been delayed for some reason. There may be a some good reason for it. I do not know. What the member for Cook talked about can be done on a voluntary basis. Why do we need this legislation, as the member for Cook said, to protect some areas on the Walsh River? It affects the whole coastal strip of Queensland on the Great Barrier Reef. Why do we need legislation as large as that to cover a small area? If there is a need to do it and it is important then people do it on a voluntary basis. The argument is not valid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070938"></A>
The member for Cook asked why we object in many instances to this type of legislation. We do not. One of the things we do object to is the lack of science. Those opposite cannot tell me that getting preferences from Greens is based on science. It is based on politics. That is the reason this bill is in the House today. The explanatory notes state that this legislation has arisen from an election commitment on 15 March. It is a political document, not a scientific document, and those opposite wonder why we are opposing it, for heaven’s sake. It is purely and simply a political tool for a political objective--to get Greens preferences--and it worked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070939"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr O’Brien:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 We have a mandate; yes, you are right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070940"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOBBS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would not say those opposite have a mandate, but it actually worked for them. Let us talk about the science involved. The minister would know all about the science because he went through a very in-depth debate in relation to science on another river system. When we finally got back and did the real science we found that, in fact, landholders were right and the government of the day was wrong. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070941"></A>
The science needs to be done. What the minister has done is make the science fit the situation. The explanatory notes state that the bill will protect mature regrowth vegetation that has not been cleared since 31 December 1989 on leasehold land for agricultural and grazing purposes, freehold land and Indigenous land. ‘Any land will do. Lock it all up.’ Government has some responsibility over leasehold land. In relation to freehold land I would have thought there would be some sort of recognition of the rights of freehold owners as in urban areas. The DOGIT area is a freehold title. It is owned by the community. There is no recognition by this government of the land tenures there. The property rights of Queenslanders are totally ignored. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1070942"></A>
This legislation should be backed by science and it certainly is not. The explanatory notes state that this is the regrowth with the highest biodiversity value. I know a bit about this. The reality is that it just cannot be true. It is simply timber that is 20-plus years old. By stating that it is of the highest biodiversity value, we know it is absolute bull. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074536"></A>
The government cannot just put those things in there. They are just words. It is putting those words in there so that people who do not know might think, ‘Wow, this is pretty good. They are looking after the environment.’ I cannot use the word that I feel like using to describe this. </Hansard-Body>

Mr Rickuss:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Garbage! </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074540"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOBBS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Garbage is a very mild word, but it is close enough to it. The explanatory notes state that the bill also maintains the protection of regrowth vegetation adjacent to watercourses in the priority Great Barrier Reef catchments of the Burdekin, Mackay-Whitsunday and the Wet Tropics. The government is going way up into the Central or North Queensland areas, which have little or no impact on the Great Barrier Reef. It does not make sense. It is not dissimilar to the wild rivers legislation. The government might have only declared three rivers as wild rivers, but it relates to 13 catchments in a sense. The government has gone far beyond what it needs to do. There are many areas that I am sure would not necessarily need this legislative cover to achieve the government’s intended purpose. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074543"></A>
Another objective relates to making vegetation management offsets and specifying the chief executive’s constraints and responsibilities. So there are offsets and that is probably not a bad thing. The vegetation mapping process has obviously been very poor and let us hope it gets better. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074544"></A>
The explanatory notes state under the reasons for policy objective that protection of regrowth vegetation was in response to the level of regrowth clearing in the 2006-07 <Hansard-Italic>
Statewide Landcover and Trees Study</Hansard-Italic>
 as well as the need to protect Queensland’s Great Barrier Reef. As I mentioned before, this is purely a political solution that the government has put in place. There are many other things that can be done and have been done. Certainly in North Queensland, particularly up in the higher rainfall areas, drainage areas have been put in place. I visited quite a few of those with Marc Rowell when he was minister. They were working extremely well. The water would filter through the swampy and grassed areas. They were made that way so that the sediments would drop and the water coming through the other side was significantly clearer than it would have been had it been left to run straight off the canefields and farm areas. There are ways in which it can be done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074548"></A>
The notes also talk about the habitat for threatened species that these areas are going to protect. Which species? Which threatened species are we talking about up in the higher catchments of these areas? Maybe someone could tell us. Maybe the minister could inform us of what the habitat for the threatened species is. It would be interesting to know so we can inform those people up there that they, in fact, have these threatened species. I doubt if they already know. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074549"></A>
It also talks about reducing pollutants within the water. As I have mentioned previously, there are existing ways to do that without having to go via the green preferences route that the government has taken. The notes state that the bill will deliver the government’s commitment to reduce the amount of pesticides and fertilisers reaching the reef by 50 per cent within four years. The government is going to take 20-year-old vegetation--20-year-old trees that are there now--and within four years it is going to reduce the amount of pesticides and fertilisers reaching the reef by 50 per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074550"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Kilburn:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 That’s right. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074551"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOBBS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Bull! That is absolute rubbish. The trees are 20 years old. They are going to be 24 years old in four years time. How on earth is the government going to stop 50 per cent of the amount of pesticides and fertilisers running off? Is it going to go out and grow grass amongst them, because there will be a lot less grass the more it allows it to pick it up. That is absolute rubbish and rot. This document has massive holes in it. I cannot believe there is such rubbish in this green paper. It is extraordinary to even think that the minister is standing over there trying to push this through by some sort of legitimate means and there is nothing of any substance at all in this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1074552"></A>
I need to quickly touch on many other parts of the bill. The notes say that there are no viable alternatives that would achieve the policy objectives. As I mentioned before, there certainly are. It has been done. I do not think we need this particular piece of legislation to achieve that. This bill is only a political document, a political tool in a political game to get green preferences. I think it is a disgrace. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr MALONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mirani--LNP) (4.34 pm): I rise to speak on the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill in the parliament today. Firstly, I congratulate the shadow minister on his very detailed and critical comment of the legislation. Before I say too much, I would like to pass comment on the impassioned speech by the member for Cook in which he defended the farmers who want to protect the revegetation along Walsh River. Quite frankly, this is an indication of how much understanding members on the opposite side of the House have in relation to this bill. Before people can extract any material from anywhere near a creek bed, of course, they have to have an extractive licence, which is quite extensive and very demanding in terms of how they rehabilitate the land afterwards and all of those sorts of things. Quite frankly, before they even get to looking at destroying regrowth in extracting that sand from the river, they would have to have some very substantial plans in place and, more importantly, approval from the department. The revegetation would have nothing whatsoever to do with the extractive industry. This is typical of backbench members on the other side of the House who do not have any understanding of what they are putting through this House. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1074557"></A>
I am not going to speak at any great length on the bill in terms of what it imposes on landholders et cetera; that has been adequately done by the shadow minister and others members of the House. What I contend to the House today is that in the bush we have a saying along the lines of, ‘You do not necessarily listen to what the salesman has to say; you look at what his actions might be.’ Quite frankly, we have a situation today where those on the other side of the House would like the voting public to think that they are the custodians of the environment here in Queensland; the Labor Party and the environment are in unison. </Hansard-Body>

I was in Rockhampton last week at those major fires. Some members would have heard me speak during the matters of public importance debate today. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MALONE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It is great to see that members on the other side are so interested in what I have to say. The fire in Rockhampton was in the Mount Archer National Park, which is encompassed within the Berserker wilderness area. It is a very significant part of Queensland--11,000 hectares or 30,000 acres of very significant ecosystems of dry rainforest country. These ecosystems are not replicated anywhere else in Queensland. Indeed, they are so very important to the people of Queensland, and more important to the people of Rockhampton, that more than $1 million was spent on a plan back in 2001 and culminated in the implementation of the plan in about 2004. I will read briefly from that report. It is an extract from something much larger. With $1 million we get quite a few pages of rhetoric. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078259"></A>
Among its aims, the Berserker Wilderness Community Action Plan states that it will ‘implement an ecologically based fire management strategy for the Berserker Wilderness’. The action plan further states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1078265"></A>
The Berserker Wilderness Fire Management Strategy provides background information on the Berserker Wilderness and detailed analysis of fire management. Also included are inventories of the flora and fauna of the area. A series of maps illustrated various aspects of the Berserker Wilderness including infrastructure, fire breaks, vegetation communities and fire zones.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1078266"></A>
In reference to managed burns in fire adapted woodland, the plan further states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1078270"></A>
Planned burning programs in cool conditions reduce fuel loads and decrease the opportunity for wildfire to spread across the Berserker Wilderness. Mosaic burning programs carried out at carefully timed intervals are important in maintaining the diversity of plants and animals in fire-adapted vegetation communities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1078271"></A>
Those are very telling words. The plan further states--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1078273"></A>
Typical fire protection measures for the protection of infrastructure include:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

• 	seasonal clean-up prior or at commencement of dry weather or fire season.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1078279"></A>
I could go on for the next 20 minutes and read extracts from that strategy, but I will not. I think members get the idea. A very substantial plan was put in place, costing $1 million plus I imagine--something in kind from the state government. Last week a wildfire started in that national park. How it came about is speculation that we do not need to go into. The fact of the matter is that quite quickly and clearly it became apparent that the management plan was never acted on. There were no breaks. There was no maintenance of the fire breaks. There was no recognition of the significant heritage of that land. There were minimal cool burns. Today in the House the minister tried to defend that.</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078280"></A>
The management of that Queensland wilderness area was an absolute disaster. It was a magnificent dry rainforest. I saw what was left. There is white ash on the ground. The fire was so hot that all that is left of that rainforest is white ash on the ground. That shows how hot the fire was. I have been on the land a long time and I know what I am taking about. I can tell the House that that forest will never grow back. Millions of animals would have been killed in that fire. Where are the greenies now? They were not out there saving those animals, and members opposite are laughing about it. There is no doubt that millions of animals would have been lost. Sacred ecosystems have been lost forever. Yet all that has happened is that today in the House the minister tried to criticise me for defending the rural firefighters who had to fight that fire in the backyards of the houses that back onto that wilderness area. That is abysmal.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078287"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MALONE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I accept your direction, Madam Deputy Speaker. I was trying to point out the fact that we are talking about the management of rural land and regrowth and how the government maintains the land that it owns. Quite frankly, what I am saying has relevance to this bill because I am looking at how rural landholders look after their land as opposed to how the government looks after its land. My view is that there are questions to be asked about the management of land, whether it be by landholders or the government that looks after the national parks, forests and wilderness areas throughout Queensland. We have to establish some mechanism by which a standard is set for the management of land across Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078288"></A>
I strongly believe we should be protecting absolutely the significant landholdings across Queensland that contain ecologically significant areas. I have no problem with that at all and our shadow minister has no problem with that. However, quite frankly, I do have problems with tying up regrowth land that will never, ever go back to the way it was. I am not sure that anybody understands what I am talking about. Once you clear land--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078289"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Wettenhall:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 We’re sure we don’t understand what you’re talking about!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078290"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MALONE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is fine; I understand that you do not understand, so we are back to square one. When you clear land, you take out the original vegetation. When it regrows, it grows far thicker and more profusely than before. The land that is available under the regrowth is almost a desert in terms of animal livelihoods or ecosystems. Regrowth will never return the ecosystem that was present before the land was cleared. Let us get that clear. That does not happen in Queensland. It may happen in other states, but it certainly does not happen in Queensland. More importantly, it certainly does not happen in the area that I come from. The idea that somehow you can lock up endangered regrowth systems and expect the land to go back to what it was before is an absolute furphy. Frankly, anybody who professes that as fact seriously should see a psychologist.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078291"></A>
I will not go on at any great length, other than to say that in the area that I come from and in quite a lot of the areas across the rest of the state the management of our national parks and forests is a disgrace. It is about time that the government used as its own benchmark the standards that it is trying to set for rural landholders. It is about time that it took a leaf out of the book of the people who manage this country, that is, the farmers and the graziers, and used their information in the management of its own land. We might be better off. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr McLINDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Beaudesert--LNP) (4.47 pm): I rise to make a contribution to the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. From listening to speakers on both sides of the House today, it is clear that each and every one of us has a desire to implement responsible land management strategies. However, the way that the government has gone about this has created contention and disillusionment in terms of the processes that were used. Most Queenslanders are fairly rational and level-headed people. If there is a process of consultation rather than dictation, one would find that people would work with the process and negotiate what they could do with their land by using best practices.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078294"></A>
What is most concerning is that many landholders, particularly in the Beaudesert electorate, who have contacted my office were none the wiser about the process. It would cost the government 55c to put a stamp on a letter to inform someone of the process that is being undertaken. It was very concerning to hear the member for Condamine say that in the past 10 years eight acts and 15 pieces of legislation have been presented to this chamber. Clearly that means one of two things: it is outrageous incompetence or it is simply drawing out the green card once a year to make sure that one’s environmental credentials are high in the perception of the community. To play those sorts of political games with thousands of Queenslanders is completely irresponsible. When the government plays political games with people’s lives, it causes them great anxiety. Many people do not understand the legislation, and I would argue that many of the government members do not understand it either. Many landholders do not know what their futures will be.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078332"></A>
A lot of these farmers I have spoken to are third and fourth generation farmers. As many members in the House have alluded to, they are extremely capable of being responsible landowners. In fact, it would be ridiculous to think that they would not be because they live on the land and from the land. These are the people whom we should be consulting with. These are our key stakeholders. We should not be centralising all of our decisions in George Street, as we have seen with this government over the last 11 years, and thinking that some level of bureaucracy parked in George Street has an understanding of the issues that these families are facing on the front line. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078334"></A>
It certainly is an infatuation with a false sense of environmental conservatism that this government tends to pull out, as we have seen, once every 12 months. This is no small issue. It applies to some 2.5 million hectares. The government needs to understand that the people of Queensland have elected each and every one of the 89 members here to have their issues dealt with in the parliament for the people. Queensland is not the government’s land. Clearly members of parliament have been elected by the people to represent them. Until the government becomes parallel with those people who are facing these types of issues and consults with them directly, it is never going to get to a fair or just negotiating point. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078335"></A>
What we have seen with the 70,000 pages now of state regulations--which is the highest of any state, and this bill is no doubt adding to the trial and error legislation that we have seen over the last decade in this House from this government--is a stagnation of real growth and real achievements that we want to make as a state. Not only is it irresponsible not to be empowering these landowners, but everybody loses out. The government loses out politically. When you talk to a lot of these families who have not been a part of that process, they are extremely upset and extremely hurt. For generations--for 100 plus years--they have looked after this land. It has produced for them and for us. Yet we leave them out of the equation, despite what they are doing for us. If we drive farmers out of the market and centralise our farmers into a Bunnings situation--if we drive a lot of those local farmers out of production--that is when we will have no choice in the future but to increase our imports and that will impact on the local economies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078337"></A>
Queensland, and Australia, is extremely self-sustainable. So there is no reason we cannot work with these landowners. It is very important to realise that three-quarters of our electorates are inside South-East Queensland. It is very easy not to appreciate the vast majority of the land mass in Queensland. It becomes very politically enticing to pass this sort of legislation that will have dire impacts on the majority of Queensland’s land mass. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078340"></A>
I would also like to acknowledge that the minister has come out to the Beaudesert electorate and met with some of the locals, and I appreciate that. It would have been a lot more beneficial if the minister had done that in the lead-up to the legislation being introduced and to have done that right across Queensland before having this knee-jerk reaction, wheeling and dealing and playing political games in the background. If the government wants to demonstrate that it is serious about responsible land management practices, then it is important to meet those people who live on the land. With such important legislation as this, it does not make any sense not to consult and not to tour Queensland inside out and meet with these key stakeholders to see (a) what they are doing and (b) what they can do to improve it. Nine times out of 10 you will find that voluntary compliance is the best method to ensure that the best outcomes are achieved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078341"></A>
The cost of regrowth, in a 2003 departmental report, equated to about $900 million. Some of that money may well be justified. But when the government gives a very small proportion, some $2 million, in order to assist them with this legislation, there is a huge disparity in terms of the impact that it will have. It is relative chickenfeed that the government is giving them to take them through this process. What rubs even more salt in the wounds is that when a lot of these people do find out that this legislation will impact upon them they have to turn around and buy a PMAV for some $321. That is extremely unjust. Not only are we taking their rights away from them and not consulting with them, but then we are going to hit them with a $321 fee just to work out exactly what is going on with their property. I think it is terribly unjust for the government to take them through that process and then to sting them with that sort of money to alleviate their anxiety. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078343"></A>
What was heartening to hear from the other side of politics was the member for Cook, who outlined in great detail the extent that farmers go to preserve their land. I welcome his contribution. I found it very enlightening to hear his understanding of what the farmers will do to protect riparian vegetation. To introduce legislation like this that will impact those very people who are taking the sorts of extreme measures that the member for Cook explained is extremely unjust. If more members took the point of view of the member for Cook we probably would not see this legislation before us today. It must be terribly frustrating for some of those people who have that understanding of not only what the farmers are going through but also what they are willing to do to make sure that they are responsible landholders. I was quite excited by the member for Cook’s level of understanding of farmers and what they do with their properties. I was getting an LNP membership form ready. It may happen yet. It might be a wise move considering his margin at the moment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078345"></A>
I think it would be terribly irresponsible for the government to pass the legislation as it stands. One thing you will always get from Queenslanders is rationale if you have a process of consultation and not dictation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CHOI</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Capalaba--ALP) (4.55 pm): I rise to support the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. In doing so, I will focus my contribution this afternoon on addressing the provisions within the bill which allow the establishment of exchange areas to replace areas of cleared high-value regrowth vegetation in certain situations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078349"></A>
The government is committed to working with farmers to achieve real environmental gains for future Queenslanders. We are committed to providing flexibility to assist farmers in meeting the climate change challenge. Most Queensland farmers care deeply for the environment in which they live and work and, as with most farmers, they are hardworking and looking for practical solutions which suit their land management situation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078352"></A>
In preparing for this bill the government has consulted with landholders, industry representatives and conservation groups during the moratorium. The government has acknowledged some concerns expressed by some of those groups and has tried to strike a very fine balance between the acknowledgement of farmers being able to work on the land and the need to address climate change. This bill ensures that the protection of high-value regrowth will not be at the expense of practical, productive and sustainable farming practices. The inclusion of exchange area provisions in this bill for regrowth vegetation is just one of several measures designed to achieve a balance between conservation and production. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078354"></A>
Under the new regrowth vegetation code, clearing high-value protected regrowth vegetation can occur in certain areas for specific purposes if another larger area of unprotected but valuable regrowth is restored and protected from further clearing in exchange for the clearing. These areas are called exchange areas. The code recognises that if clearing cannot be reasonably avoided, in such instances as when building infrastructure, certain high-value regrowth areas can be cleared for these purposes. Similarly, clearing can be undertaken for an extractive industry that is not exempt if an exchange area is provided. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1078356"></A>
The code also allows landholders to clear a small, isolated area of endangered regrowth if they provide an exchange area that improves environmental outcomes on or near their properties, such as protecting vegetation to provide a corridor for wildlife. I envisage that is a pristine waterfall or waterhole out there somewhere with native fauna and flora which has been used by landowners as a swimming hole for generations. This area may not fall under the protected area but may be a prime example of regrowth which should be preserved. It may be a critical part of the region’s environmental balance for birds and animals from near and far. Who would know this better than the long-term landowners themselves? In these circumstances, we give the landowners opportunities to negotiate for that land to be preserved forever in place of other land which would otherwise have been protected in its stead. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082363"></A>
The code specifies minimum requirements that must be met to ensure the regrowth vegetation selected as an exchange area will result in improved property or regional environmental outcomes. Exchange areas can also be selected by protecting regulated regrowth where clearing is otherwise permitted. This ensures that valuable regrowth in sensitive parts of the landscape continues to be protected, such as habitat for threatened species and vegetation near creeks and wetlands and on steep slopes. Landholders are required to notify the Department of Environment and Resource Management if they intend to clear regulated regrowth and if they provide an exchange area as part of their clearing activity under the code. Details of the location and extent of the exchange area are required as part of the notification. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082368"></A>
To provide some flexibility for exchange areas and to assist in achieving improved environmental and natural resource outcomes across the landscape, the code does not restrict the selection of an exchange area to within the notifying landholder’s property. In this way, landholders can work together in seeking practical solutions in managing regrowth on their properties and right across the landscape. Flexibility for farmers is the underlying principle of these changes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082371"></A>
The code also allows non-regulated regrowth vegetation that has not been cleared in the last 10 years or that is two or more metres in height to be used as an exchange area. For instance, landholders can select areas of category X vegetation on a PMAV as an exchange area if it meets the age or height requirement. The code also sets minimum size limits and area ratios for exchange areas. This is to ensure the area of vegetation adequately replaces the cleared regrowth and is large enough to survive as a viable and ecologically functioning area of vegetation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082374"></A>
Once an exchange area is provided and the details recorded on the notification form, the department will make a PMAV over the exchange area and show it as a category A area. This will ensure that the exchange area is protected under the vegetation management framework. The PMAV will also create a record of the exchange area as part of the department’s ongoing monitoring of compliance with the code. Protecting new areas in exchange for clearing high-value regrowth provides a balance between practical production and enhanced environmental outcomes at the property and landscape scale. This is good for the environment and good for landowners. I therefore commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms JARRATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Whitsunday--ALP) (5.02 pm): In rising to participate in the debate on the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009, I will address an area of particular relevance to my electorate, and that is the protection of riparian vegetation for priority reef catchments and how this will help to improve water quality and safeguard the health of the Great Barrier Reef. There are a range of reasons that this government is acting now to protect this vegetation. I will outline the two most important reasons here today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082380"></A>
First, on 29 January this year the Premier announced that the discharge of dangerous pesticides and fertilisers capable of killing the Great Barrier Reef would be cut by 50 per cent within four years. Second, the annual Statewide Landcover and Trees Study, or SLATS, report for 2006-07 showed that, while clearing of remnant vegetation has slowed, unsustainable rates of clearing of regrowth vegetation were still occurring in Queensland. Further, the report showed that approximately 30 per cent of that clearing--some 69,000 hectares every year--was occurring in reef catchments. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082382"></A>
For these reasons, the Premier made a commitment during the state election on 15 March 2009 that a new Labor government would act to introduce a moratorium on the clearing of the highest value regrowth. A moratorium on clearing endangered regrowth and vegetation associated with certain watercourses in the priority reef catchments of the Burdekin, the Wet Tropics and Mackay-Whitsunday took effect from 8 April this year while the government consulted on the best way forward. That moratorium expired on 7 October 2009. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082385"></A>
This bill will protect high-value regrowth vegetation and help deliver this government’s commitment to protect the Great Barrier Reef. The new measures will regulate the clearing of natural regrowth vegetation within 50 metres of mapped watercourses in the Wet Tropics, Burdekin and Mackay-Whitsunday priority reef catchments as well as high-value regrowth not recleared since the end of December 1989 across the state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082387"></A>
These priority reef catchments have been identified as high-risk areas due to their pollution loads and proximity to the Great Barrier Reef. Native woody vegetation regrowth within 50 metres of mapped watercourses in these three priority reef catchments will be subject to new regulations, and that will concern a total of approximately 200,000 hectares. The affected watercourses have been mapped by the Department of Environment and Resource Management at a scale of one to 100,000. This mapping allows for accurate identification of the affected watercourses. Maps showing these watercourses can be downloaded free of charge from DERM’s website. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082394"></A>
This bill amends the vegetation management framework to regulate regrowth clearing through a performance based compliance code backed up by a suite of appropriate compliance measures. Landholders will no longer need a permit for clearing regrowth on leasehold land if they clear in accordance with the new regrowth code. This approach allows for responsible self-management and does not present great change for those landholders who are already doing the right thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082399"></A>
Within the 50 metres from these watercourses, the code allows for some clearing to occur including for weed control, thinning thickened vegetation and infrastructure. The code will allow for clearing outside a buffer width which increases with the size of the stream up to 450 metres for larger watercourses. The code also provides guidance for voluntary best practice for vegetation management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082401"></A>
It is also important to understand that the new regrowth regulations do not affect existing landholders’ entitlements over land already certified as category X on a property map of assessable vegetation, or PMAV. Other important fire management exemptions such as clearing for fire breaks, fire management lines or burning to reduce hazardous fuel loads will not be affected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082404"></A>
The protection of riparian vegetation under this bill will have multiple environmental benefits including having good vegetation cover to help filter run-off from properties and remove water-borne pollutants before they enter the waterways. There will also be significant benefits for both land and aquatic biodiversity. In addition, retaining a vegetative buffer along watercourses will improve bank stability and help prevent sediments being discharged into the river system and on to the lagoon. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082408"></A>
The current condition of riparian vegetation in reef catchments is well known. The Burdekin Water Quality Improvement Plan, for example, shows a large decline in the condition of riparian habitat in many subcatchments due to flood plain and riparian clearing. Similarly, the Reef Water Quality Protection Plan--known as the reef plan--has identified that run-off from broadscale land activities, particularly where vegetation has been cleared or overgrazed, is one of the primary drivers of long-term decline in water quality and Great Barrier Reef ecosystem health. </Hansard-Body>

The primary aim of the reef plan is to reduce levels of pollutants entering the reef from various sources such as sediments and chemicals being discharged from broadscale land activities. The new clearing measures will help achieve this goal as well as this government’s goal of reducing the level of pesticides and fertilisers reaching the reef by 50 per cent within four years. </Hansard-Body>

The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world’s largest coral reef ecosystems and one of the most complex natural systems on earth. The area has significant environmental, social, economic and cultural values and plays an important role in the local, regional and national economies. The new measures will contribute to protecting the Great Barrier Reef by reducing sedimentation and nutrient run-off and maintaining biodiversity. Improved water quality will result in healthier reef ecosystems with more capacity to withstand the effects of climate change. This bill supports the government’s commitment to improve water quality and the environment and is an essential measure for protecting the health of the reef and the sustainable future of our state. I commend the minister and his department, and I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CRIPPS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Hinchinbrook--LNP) (5.08 pm): I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. The bill amends the Vegetation Management Act and the Integrated Planning Act 1997 to provide a new legislative framework for the management of regrowth vegetation in Queensland. This legislation has arisen from a pre-election commitment made by Premier Bligh earlier this year which included a temporary moratorium on the clearing of regrowth vegetation and regrowth vegetation adjacent to watercourses in North Queensland that flow into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. At least the explanatory notes accompanying the bill are honest in this regard. This is a political decision which derives from a pre-election preference deal between Labor and the Greens. This bill is the final part of that deal being delivered after the Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Bill went through the parliament during the last sitting. Both of these bills have targeted North Queensland landowners with unjustified and arbitrary regulation and restrictions on their properties and farm businesses.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086378"></A>
It is true that the state government has undertaken consultation with stakeholder groups in relation to both this bill and the Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Bill. I offer my compliments to the rural industry groups for their patience and restraint when dealing with a government which has no appreciation of the significant impost its legislation will have on the viability of rural industries.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086379"></A>
They have engaged in the consultation process to try to mitigate the impact of this increased regulation on their industries and the regional communities they sustain. As a result of this consultation, it is recognised that the bill proposes a ban on the clearing of regrowth vegetation that has not been cleared since 31 December 1989. It is argued that this is the regrowth with the highest biodiversity value and it is least likely to occur on productive land. This is an improvement on what was originally mooted to be the intention of the government. In support of this view, it is noted that the green groups with which the government did the pre-election preference deal are decrying the provisions of the bill as not going far enough. A cynic would be forgiven for wondering what the government will do now to top up the deal in view of its relative restraint in implementing this new ban on clearing regrowth vegetation that has not been cleared since 31 December 1989 following consultation with rural industry groups. Changes of heart by the government on vegetation management issues are nothing new, although it is new for it to favour rural Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086381"></A>
The state Labor government has never been able to get this legislation right. Every time it dreams up a new excuse to tighten the screws on rural industry or when it has pressure put on it by the Greens to tighten the screws on rural industry it has brought in more amendments to fix up its own mistakes and to belt landowners. The result has been widespread uncertainty, frustration and confusion for landowners who have been kicked around like a political football in the ongoing game between Labor and the Greens.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086382"></A>
In 2004, when Minister Robertson previously had responsibility for this portfolio, an amendment bill was debated in this place which was presented to rural industry groups and rural landowners as providing certainty for producers to manage their land in a locally relevant and sustainable manner. <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>
 records Minister Robertson in this parliament saying--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1086384"></A>
This legislation is a historical line in the sand for how we, as a community, manage our often fragile landscapes and their natural limitations to ensure we remain economically and ecologically sustainable.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086385"></A>
That was the undertaking by this minister--a line in the sand. Certainty was promised. That was the basis upon which that debate took place. Clearly, that undertaking has been violated. That line in the sand has been crossed and that certainty has been undermined. Those words should haunt the minister as he carries this bill through the parliament. Here we are again amending the Vegetation Management Act for the eighth time in the nine years since it was first enacted, including numerous times since 2004 when Minister Robertson and the state government promised certainty to landowners and rural industries.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086386"></A>
Is it any wonder then that there are such widespread questions about the government’s honesty and integrity when this type of clear and unambiguous undertaking is so fundamentally cast aside for base political purposes? Is it any wonder that there is no confidence in the government in regional Queensland? Can the minister finally say to Queensland landowners that the state government is finished with them after so many amendments to the legislation that have constantly changed the goalposts in relation to the management of, firstly, remnant and, now, regrowth vegetation? Can the minister finally say to Queensland landowners that they can now get on with their lives and plan for the future of their farm businesses with confidence and certainty that the goalposts will not be moved again? Even if the minister did give such an undertaking, as he has done previously, would it have any credibility?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086387"></A>
While I welcome the bittersweet news that the ban on clearing regrowth vegetation will be limited to that which has not been cleared since 31 December 1989, the bill has not been curtailed in respect of its proposed ban on all clearing of regrowth vegetation regardless of its age adjacent to watercourses in the Burdekin, Mackay-Whitsunday and Wet Tropics catchment areas. We in North Queensland are still going to cop the full bottle of the new control measures on the management of regrowth vegetation regardless of its age or environmental value. As such, in this bill there are proposed 50-metre so-called buffer zones that will apply to landowners in my electorate of Hinchinbrook in the Wet Tropics catchment and other areas of North Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086392"></A>
As I mentioned earlier, North Queensland has been targeted by the government in recent times. Properties in North Queensland, and in particular in Far North Queensland, have been subject to the imposition of several layers of additional regulation and restriction by this government. In Far North Queensland the regional plan has recently introduced areas of ecological significance mapping attached to the statutory planning instrument covering thousands of square kilometres of land.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086396"></A>
The recently debated Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Bill imposed a 20-metre no-spray set-back buffer zone each side of a watercourse in the same three North Queensland catchment areas contained in this bill. Now this bill seeks to introduce a 50-metre buffer zone each side of a watercourse in these three catchments, banning the clearing of any regrowth vegetation regardless of its age or perceived environmental value.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086400"></A>
Is it any wonder that North Queensland landowners are throwing up their hands in frustration under the weight of all of this red tape and bureaucracy--the layer upon layer of regulation? Is it any wonder that they are facing serious questions about their ongoing viability when the regulatory burden they carry is massive thanks to this government? This is the reality of the situation for landowners and for rural industries in North Queensland. The policies of the government are undermining the economic viability of landowners and rural industries in North Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086403"></A>
The market value of their properties is significantly affected by the rules, regulations and restrictions of this proposed legislation and the other layers of legislation and regulation that I just mentioned. What landowners purchased in good faith at the time--the land, the capacity to utilise the land for productive purposes and the property rights associated with that land--have been substantially withdrawn, curtailed and eroded by this government. It has done so on each occasion without any compensation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086404"></A>
The explanatory notes accompanying the bill state that the ban on the clearing of mature regrowth will supposedly ensure that threatened ecosystems will be protected and will assist in protecting sensitive areas such as steep slopes, wetlands, watercourses and habitat for threatened species. The explanatory notes go on to say specifically that the retention of vegetation either side of watercourses in North Queensland catchments can assist with improving bank stability and reduce pollutants entering the river systems and ultimately the Great Barrier Reef lagoon.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086407"></A>
As such, the bill proposes a vegetation buffer of 50 metres of native vegetation either side of watercourses in North Queensland, catchments to supposedly improve bank stability and supposedly reduce the level of pollutants such as sediments and chemicals entering the reef lagoon as well as delivering enhanced biodiversity benefits. This is an issue I addressed when the moratorium bill was debated in this place in April this year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086409"></A>
One of the principal frustrations that I have in relation to these 50-metre buffer zones is that they are by their very nature arbitrary, having no regard for the actual or real run-off areas either side of any given watercourse in one of the three catchment areas in North Queensland covered by this bill. Depending on the lay of the land in particular catchment areas or even in a certain part of a particular catchment, a run-off area could be 10 metres or 100 metres from the banks of the watercourse.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086413"></A>
Either way, it is certainly never uniformly 50 metres along the length of any given watercourse in these three North Queensland catchment areas. This bill is just proposing buffer zones or an arbitrary width that have no regard for or reference to the landscape that they are going through. This highlights the lack of scientific or practical knowledge underpinning the implementation of these regulations. The same issue undermined the credibility of the provisions of the Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086418"></A>
Watercourses in these three catchments that are targeted by the bill--the Wet Tropics, the Burdekin and the Mackay-Whitsunday catchments--are certainly different between themselves. As I have said before, in the Wet Tropics catchment, which covers my electorate of Hinchinbrook, we tend to have relatively short watercourses that have relatively small catchment areas located between the Great Dividing Range and the coastline.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086458"></A>
In the Wet Tropics catchment, the landscape is undulating and hilly. Watercourses in the Wet Tropics catchment area generally run through flood plains. They run strongly because of the enormous volume of rain that periodically falls inside those catchment areas, rather than the land being shaped in such a way that the watercourses have large run-off areas feeding them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086459"></A>
These circumstances are in contrast to the situation in the Burdekin catchment. There, the land is much flatter, with huge run-off areas. Unlike the Wet Tropics catchment area, many of these watercourses do not run all year round. They run only periodically, when they have significant rainfall. Yet they will all have the same buffer zones that will take out production on those properties. As it is flatter country, the behaviour of the water when those watercourses are flowing is different from what happens in the Wet Tropics. But all of that counts for nothing, because these provisions are arbitrary. The buffer zones are 10 metres regardless of whether the real run-off catchment area is 10 metres or 100 metres. This, more than any other aspect of this legislation, illustrates that it is not based on science; it is based on politics. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086461"></A>
What makes me particularly angry is, just like the provisions of the Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Bill, this bill has a total lack of recognition of landowners in rural industries in North Queensland in terms of the progress and improvements that they have made in land management practices over the past two decades. The state government offers--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086463"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr CRIPPS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I hear the interjections from the honourable members opposite. In this regard, the state government offers token congratulations and empty platitudes but then it promptly proceeds to turn the screws on the landowners affected by this bill and the other bills that I have mentioned this afternoon. Innovation by landowners over the past two decades done on a voluntary basis, such as the development of wetland sediment traps, green trash blanketing, chemical application certification across industries, expensive laser levelling to improve drainage and best practice application rates for fertilisers--all of these efforts--is virtually ignored in favour of regulation. The list of voluntary efforts by landowners is long, but there is no real recognition--just a punitive, big-stick approach and more bureaucratic regulation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086464"></A>
There are literally thousands of watercourses in the Wet Tropics catchment. If the state government imposes this arbitrary 50-metre buffer zone rule along the length of every watercourse on every property within that catchment, we will certainly find that this legislation will have a significant impact on agricultural production in the Wet Tropics. The maps associated with this legislation identifying the watercourses that will be captured by the bill are truly frightening. For my electorate, which is covered by the Wet Tropics catchment, and for other electorates that are covered by the Wet Tropics, Burdekin or Mackay-Whitsunday catchment areas where these 50-metre buffer zones will be imposed on landowners, the impact on rural industries will be serious. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086465"></A>
The minister’s second reading speech states that the new regrowth regulations will cover an additional one million hectares of regrowth vegetation of high environmental value and all regrowth vegetation within 50 metres of a watercourse in these three North Queensland catchments. These one million hectares will be taken out of the control of freehold and leasehold landowners which could otherwise be used for valuable primary production and from now on will be controlled by the government. That will undoubtedly have a devastating effect on industry and jobs in regional Queensland. Such a huge shift in property rights forced by the state could not have anything other than a profoundly serious impact on land valuations, production capacity, farm incomes and jobs in regional communities. Such a huge amount of private property cannot just be torn away from private landowners and not have a real impact on Queensland’s regional economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086466"></A>
A fundamental principle is that where the state deprives individual landowners of their private property rights, supposedly in the public interest, those disadvantaged property owners should be afforded fair compensation. It is extraordinary that no compensation will be afforded to affected landowners as a result of the passage of this bill. I ask members opposite to consider if they think that is fair and just. The LNP believes strongly in private property rights. We take private property rights seriously. The LNP believes that the overwhelming majority of landowners in Queensland manage their properties sustainably. Sadly, the state government consistently chooses to punish the many for the indiscretions of the few. Instead of putting resources into identifying the minority doing the wrong thing, Labor always opts for the blunt, arbitrary instrument of regulation that disadvantages everyone, including the people doing the right thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086467"></A>
Lastly, I want to address some of the comments made by the member for Toowoomba North. The member for Toowoomba North dismissed the scathing report by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee in respect of this bill as a report containing comments that are almost routinely presented to this parliament in relation to other bills. That statement in and of itself is ridiculous. The member for Toowoomba North then went on to say something very interesting and very instructive. The member for Toowoomba North argued that the members of the LNP opposition were hypocrites for regularly supporting bills that come before this House in respect of law enforcement and police powers to deal with criminals that the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee considers to be a breach of fundamental legislative principles and not to have sufficient regard for the rights and liberties of individuals but then opposing this bill. In doing so, the member for Toowoomba North is endorsing, and even equating the use in this bill of, the same legislative measures used to deal with private landowners that are regularly used to justify bills that propose to breach fundamental legislative principles and not have sufficient regard for the rights and liberties of individuals to deal with criminals. I think it is an extraordinary parallel to be drawn by the member for Toowoomba North. I wonder if it is an insight into the attitudes of other members opposite. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (5.26 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009. At the outset, I thank the member for Burnett for swapping speaking positions to allow me to speak to this bill at this time of the evening. I note that some government members have spoken in support of the bill on the basis that we need to take action because of the impact that humans are having on our environment, on our world, on Queensland and on Australia. I certainly support the call to take action to better protect our environment and to be very careful in our actions. But I cannot support this bill, because it is another step in the removal of landowner property rights without providing opportunities for the payment of fair and just compensation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086475"></A>
For as long as I have been a member of this state parliament I have always passionately supported and joined other members in saying that if you are going to take away property rights from landowners, from Queenslanders, you need to make sure that there is a provision of fair and just compensation for the removal of those rights. As I understand it, this bill clearly does not provide for the provision of fair and just compensation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086476"></A>
I also find it very difficult to reconcile the apparent inconsistencies of some government members in their passionate support for this bill and their passionate support for the damming of the Mary River, the loss of good agricultural land and the effect that that dam, if it is finally approved, will have on the hinterland of the region. I find that totally inconsistent. It justifies my concern that sometimes government members will take whatever stance they take to support the position that is before them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086477"></A>
I see no consistency in the decisions being made by this government. On the one hand it is saying that we need to take action to protect our environment and that we need to prevent and put more restrictions on the clearing of regrowth vegetation, and on the other hand it says that it is well and good that we are going to have the most green, or environmentally sustainable, dam in Queensland, or perhaps the world, by building the Traveston Crossing Dam. I certainly cannot support that. I will not support that and I find it very inconsistent to take this line of argument. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086511"></A>
A number of members have commented on the report of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. I certainly do not intend to repeat those comments. I will be listening with a great deal of interest to the minister’s response to the issues that have been raised by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee and referred to by members in this House. I am disappointed that some members seem to treat the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee’s comments with the view that sometimes one listens and sometimes one does not. The reality is that we have only one House of parliament in Queensland. We have no House of review and unless we are prepared to take on board the comments made by our parliamentary committee system and give them some credibility we may as well as throw the committee system out the door. I believe that the committee system has an important role to play in parliament. I believe that we need to give the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee credibility when it makes comments and raises significant questions. I look forward to listening to the minister’s response to the range of issues that the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee has tried to genuinely raise in a non-political perspective. I may be wrong, but my recollection is that there has never been an occasion when the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee has come down with recommendations that have not been unanimous decisions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086512"></A>
We talk about trying to manage the impact that humans are having on our environment. In our part of Queensland we see the hinterland of the Sunshine Coast being sacrificed so that the state government can allow more and more people to move into South-East Queensland. It knows that there is not enough water in the current area so it says it will dam part of the Sunshine Coast area, take land away from the community and sacrifice it to support the increased population growth. The reality is that our land can only support a certain population. I am very disappointed that the government is prepared to sacrifice the Mary Valley so it can accommodate more people in other parts of South-East Queensland. The growth in South-East Queensland is having a significant impact on my part of the region. Koala habitats are under threat because the power system needs to be upgraded. Powerlink is currently investigating a new corridor that will have a significant impact on our koala habitat. A pipeline corridor is underway that will also have a significant impact on our community.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1086513"></A>
The member for Burnett has allowed me the opportunity to take his speaking position. Other members want to speak.

Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.31 pm): I will make a short contribution given that we want to move into the next phase. I want to cover a few points that are relevant to my portfolio. As members are well aware, during the campaign the Premier announced that the discharge of fertilisers and pesticides impacting on the Great Barrier Reef will be cut by 50 per cent in four years. In addition, the Premier also committed to introduce a moratorium on the clearing of the highest value regrowth. This legislation therefore complements the laws that this parliament passed at the last sitting to protect the Great Barrier Reef.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086516"></A>
This side of the House understands the real threat of climate change to the environment and to the economy. We are stepping up to the plate while those opposite continue to debate whether climate change even exists. Importantly, this legislation will address the protection of riparian vegetation for priority reef catchments. It will improve water quality and safeguard the health of the Great Barrier Reef. It is something that the environment movement, as well as agricultural industries, support in order to move towards a sustainable future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086517"></A>
Protecting riparian vegetation along major waterways, streams and wetlands is a critical component in protecting the health of the Great Barrier Reef. The reef is a light-limited ecosystem and its health depends on high levels of water clarity and low levels of nutrients. A major threat to the reef is from sediment that blocks light and also carries nutrients. The nutrients promote algae blooms and feed the young crown-of-thorns starfish, the greatest cause of reef coral loss over the past 50 years. Sediment also carries weed poisons in harmful amounts out to the reef as far as 60 kilometres from the river mouths.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086518"></A>
Riparian vegetation is essential for reef catchment health. The reef ecosystem depends on riparian vegetation to keep soils stable and reduce the possibility of erosion from rivers and tributaries. We must act now. As the member for Whitsunday eloquently put it, the Great Barrier Reef is Queensland’s most treasured ecosystem. I know that this is something she is very passionate about because of her back garden and also because she understands that it supports around $6 billion worth of industry and jobs here in Queensland. I think it actually supports around 63,000 jobs in Queensland apart from its significant environmental values.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086519"></A>
The reef is suffering from a range of factors, including farming activities in the catchments that flow into the reef’s waters. Scientific evidence is telling us that there are damaging levels of fertiliser, sediment and pesticides in reef waters. This is not my evidence but the evidence from many respected scientists who have dedicated their lives to saving the reef. If anyone wants to look at debating the science all they have to do is look at the debate that we had the last time this parliament sat when we did the right thing and introduced the Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086520"></A>
To help achieve our objectives, the Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Act, which was passed earlier this month, complements what we are achieving here through the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. This legislation works directly with amendments proposed in the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill by protecting the vegetation in these priority reef catchments. As has been mentioned, the new laws control clearing of regrowth along certain watercourses in these priority catchments. These laws are a workable approach and have been prepared with extensive consultation with landholders. I acknowledge the hard work of my colleague, the other minister in the Department of Environment and Resource Management cluster. He has done a fantastic job in consulting with everybody who has a stake in this legislation. I know that industry in particular has been very supportive of the approach that the minister has taken. In actual fact, I would go so far as to say that some of the comments that we have heard from those opposite are actually out of step with what industry is saying when it comes to this bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086521"></A>
The new laws will contribute to saving the reef by reducing soil and nutrient run-off. In my opinion, this is about providing resilience: we are giving resilience to the reef which is under threat. With this bill we show our credentials to improve water quality in the environment and give the reef the best chance for a sustainable future by protecting not only its environmental qualities but also the jobs and the extra benefits it brings to our economy as outlined by other members on our side. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Burdekin--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.36 pm): Again we debate yet another bill before the House involving management of vegetation in Queensland. This bill is in response to the Bligh Labor government’s election promise to protect regrowth vegetation or, as it is now termed, endangered regrowth vegetation. It follows on from the Vegetation Management (Regrowth Clearing Moratorium) Bill debated in April this year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086524"></A>
The real purpose of this bill, apart from introducing new measures for protection of what the government has deemed endangered regional ecosystems, is to provide further legislative boundaries towards the protection of the Great Barrier Reef. The government believes that these processes will assist in reducing the level of sediments flowing out to the reef.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086525"></A>
This legislation will restrict and basically ban the clearing of mature regrowth, or what is identified as regrowth, from land cleared prior to 31 December 1989. As well it places a ban on the clearing of all regrowth adjacent to watercourses in the Great Barrier Reef catchments of the Burdekin, Mackay-Whitsundays and the Wet Tropics. I represent the area of the Lower Burdekin and a large area surrounding the upper catchments of the Burdekin River. This legislation will seriously impact many constituents and many landholders in this area. All North Queenslanders are aware of the importance and the fragility of the Great Barrier Reef. It is a true national icon of Australia. We are all very much aware of that. We certainly all recognise the importance of its protection, preservation and particularly taking note of the encroachment of human activity.</Hansard-Body>

As I have said before in this House, the people of North Queensland have grown up beside this World Heritage icon and care for it more than anyone else. They have fished, snorkelled and marvelled at its beauty just as much as all of the tourists and the scientists who swarm to the reef each year. Agriculturists, pastoralists and other landholders who have properties in the catchment are fully aware of how their practices could impact on the reef.</Hansard-Body>

Growers are fully aware of the potential hazards of their industry and they are willing to work with governments to achieve the best outcomes. Many growers have already set up innovative schemes and processes to assist the environmental management of their properties, and these have been at their own costs. I will uphold the practices of agriculturalists in North Queensland as I believe the majority of landholders are very responsibly managing their properties. </Hansard-Body>

Growers, agriculturalists and landholders respond to education. They will respond to education rather than blanket-approach legislation, and that is the cry that has come up in so many areas. There are so many changes from technology; there are so many new innovative processes, and that is what we should be looking at for the furtherance of our agricultural industries and, of course, for the protection of our natural environment. It is a focus on education. </Hansard-Body>

The Canegrowers organisation has frequently voiced concerns over imposed regulations on landowners. Sure, it has given some tacit agreement to this legislation but only because it has been imposed upon it and it has tried to make the best of what has been put to it. Its concerns over time have been that it could make it difficult or impossible to initiate voluntary change within farming practices--voluntary change that goes beyond a least common denominator with restrictive legislation such as what we have seen recently with the Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Bill measures that are being imposed on farmers, as well as what we are seeing in this restrictive vegetation management policy today. </Hansard-Body>

Let us look at it. Common sense certainly suggests that areas stripped bare along the edge of a waterway could result in soil erosion and cause further sediment to wash away into the downstream waters during flood events. However, what the government bureaucrats fail to see is that all landholders do have a pride of ownership in their property. They are sensible people. They do have a very astute awareness of land management and they do put that into practice. It is patronising and I think extremely insulting to those very good land managers who do exist to impose these blanket-type restrictions with no real knowledge of individual areas, individual practices, land and soil types and run-off positions. Queenslanders have a right to feel secure in their business decisions just as do landholders who may be affected by this legislation and the previous Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Bill and who will have made decisions that have huge economic and practical ramifications. </Hansard-Body>

The regulatory approach adopted by the state government is incorrect and was designed only to fulfil an election commitment to appease the green movement. It is noted that, in respect of this particular legislation, industry bodies such as AgForce and QFF have expressed the opinion that the provisions included in this bill have addressed some of the concerns that were raised during the moratorium, and that is a point to be noted. However, landholders along the Burdekin River catchment and the other catchments along the north coast in the prescribed area are being seriously targeted by the provisions of this legislation. This further legislation makes a mockery of the 2006 legislation which--as we have been reminding the minister quite regularly this afternoon he stated--was a line in the sand. But that line in the sand has certainly washed away now. Landholders have accepted those provisions as outlined in the previous vegetation management legislation and they have been working responsibly within those guidelines. It comes as another slap in the face to North Queenslanders that guidelines now place further restrictions on already overregulated industry bodies. This legislation does take into account existing property management by landholders by honouring the government’s commitment to maintain landholders’ certainty for category X areas on property maps of assessable vegetation which, of course, are most commonly known as PMAVs. However, it will still impact on the economic viability and certainty of many agriculturalists and pastoralists. </Hansard-Body>

Let us look at it. The primary industries sector is a very valuable area in the Queensland economy. The value of Queensland primary industry commodities in the 2008-09 year was around $13 billion, and it is our second largest export sector. The fact that the agricultural industry is vital to the Queensland economy often seems to slip beneath this government’s radar. Over 100,000 people are employed by the combined primary industries sector and the implementation of these further restrictions may very well impact on that employment. It also impacts on the rights of landowners and the basic rights of democratic ownership. The LNP believes that, where those rights are eroded or removed, adequate compensation should be in place, and we are certainly seeing no signs of that in this legislation. Yet again, we are seeing this Labor government with its socialist approach totally ignoring the rights of property ownership and eroding again property rights. Many people ask: what will the LNP do? Let me just share with you what the LNP policy in respect of this would be. An LNP government would ensure enforcement and compliance is conducted in an even-handed manner without negative assumptions about the intentions of landholders. </Hansard-Body>

 It would ensure further policy development is backed by science and does not negatively impact on private business arrangements without adequate compensation, and well the members on the other side might interject.

This bill seeks to protect riparian or watercourse vegetation in priority reef catchments which, of course, are those identified by the department maps in the Burdekin, Whitsunday and Wet Tropics areas. With respect particularly to the Burdekin area, I would ask the minister to actually define what a watercourse is. As he no doubt would be aware, within the water board and irrigation areas in the Burdekin are many man-made channels that are part of the delivery system for water as well as the very important role of replenishment of the underground aquifers, and they have been there for many years. Are these artificial, man-made channels also classified as watercourses as defined in the provisions of this bill? This really will open up a huge, shall we say, can of worms in the implementation of this legislation right across the Burdekin irrigation area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1090854"></A>
As we see, this bill has yet again specifically targeted particularly agricultural industries and landholders without using the necessary scientific background for its unfounded assumptions. It has made assumptions--broad assumptions--on areas without an understanding of each specific area. </Hansard-Body>

As we have said, this legislation is based on a politically based election commitment. It is based on a promise to the Greens at the expense of landowners.

Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--LNP) (5.49 pm): This legislation is dangerous to both the environment and the Queensland economy. It has been brought to this chamber by a party that thinks we can stop climate change by paying more money in extra taxes to Kevin Rudd. This legislation creates more unnecessary government red tape, more inefficiencies and there is no doubt that this legislation will cause a loss of jobs. On the weekend the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 published an article by Rodney Chester which looked at the problem of bureaucratic red tape. It was titled ‘The nanny state’. Chester warned that the Queensland state economy was losing $17.9 billion a year due to overregulation from federal, state and local governments. He also said that Queensland has 70,000 pages of regulation, which is 10 per cent more than the next highest state. This legislation will add to the $17.9 billion in overregulation. This legislation will add to--not lessen--the 70,000 pages of regulation in this state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095015"></A>
At a time when the world’s No. 1 priority is food security, this legislation will compromise our state primary producers’ ability to contribute to Australia’s food security. The legislation will not offer more meaningful protection to the environment. I am very happy to be part of an opposition that will vote against this legislation. I congratulate the member for Callide and shadow minister and all members who have spoken against this legislation for their very measured, rational and honest assessment of it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095016"></A>
This legislation amends six acts and makes a consequential amendment to another act, the State Development and Public Works Organisation Act 1971, and also the Vegetation Management Regulation. The bill has come about because of an election commitment--a political bribe, in fact--from the Bligh government to appease the Greens and secure Green preferences in what was seen as one of the most spectacular dirty deals in this state’s history. The explanatory notes state--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095019"></A>
The main purpose of the Bill is to amend the <Hansard-Italic>
Vegetation Management Act 1999 </Hansard-Italic>
(VMA) and <Hansard-Italic>
Integrated Planning Act 1997</Hansard-Italic>
 ... to provide a new legislative framework for the protection of important regrowth vegetation. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095020"></A>
Additionally, the bill amends the Land Act 1994 and the Land Title Act 1994 to extend the halt on the registration of title boundary survey plans. As the shadow minister has correctly noted, this is the eighth time in nine years this legislation has been amended. In itself that proves many things. Firstly, it proves that these changes are in no way based on science; they are based on political dogma. The changes seek to deliberately erode the property rights of Queenslanders and, therefore, create controversy, outrage and protest within the rural community which will then be turned around and marketed in the south-east corner. The way that the government is going to market this is very calculated and very cunning. The Labor spin doctors seek to create the impression, especially in the south-east corner and Brisbane, that the Labor Party is the one who cares for the environment. However, as speaker after speaker has proven, this legislation is technically flawed and practically flawed. Today I will bring to the attention of the House some examples that support this argument. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095021"></A>
In looking at how the legislation is technically flawed one need go no further than the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee’s assessment of this legislation to see proof of bad laws that will compromise the rights and liberties of Queensland families. Even the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee, a committee dominated by members of the government, with regard to the rights and liberties of individuals draws the attention of the parliament to eight clauses within this legislation--clauses 15, 32, 36, 32, 43, 2, 48 and 46--which have the potential to affect the rights and liberties of individuals. The committee notes that clause 32 has--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1095023"></A>
... scope to affect significantly rights and liberties of individuals but with limited safeguards of rights and liberties;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1095024"></A>
•	clause 43 which would exclude avenues of review and appeal ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1095025"></A>
•	clauses 2 and 48 allowing many provisions of the bill to have retrospective operation; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1095026"></A>
•	clause 46 which may provide for compulsory acquisition of property other than with fair compensation. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095027"></A>
According to the government dominated Scrutiny of Legislation Committee, this legislation even raises questions about whether this bill has sufficient regard to the institution of parliament. The report states that clause 16 may authorise the amendment of an act other than by way of another act. As we have heard even from Independent speakers on this side of the House, this committee must be taken seriously. As we know, we are a unicameral parliament. We do not have an upper house, and the committee process is supposed to provide a check and balance to stop bad legislation being passed. Unfortunately, it appears that if the government members vote the way they have in previous years then bad legislation will pass through this place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095029"></A>
The legislation is also practically flawed. Many farming families have contacted my office with regard to the financial and physical hurt and harm caused by this government’s heavy handed, unfair and dysfunctional management of vegetation over the past decade. Indeed, many blue-collar workers have contacted my office. They are the people whom those on the opposite side purport to represent. They have contacted me to lodge their protests against the government’s mismanagement of vegetation which has slashed the value of their investments. Often land set aside for retirement nest eggs has been completely decimated by this government’s management of vegetation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095030"></A>
At a time when all those in Queensland and certainly all those in this chamber should be genuflecting in thanks for our primary industries for the magnificent job that they are doing battling fires, floods and drought while creating wealth and jobs and feeding not only Queensland but also Australia and the world, again in this place we are dealing with shameful legislation that has been introduced for base political purposes and that will throw more red tape at primary producers and landowners. </Hansard-Body>

The primary producers of the Burnett are some of the best in the world. We grow an abundance of produce. We grow every conceivable small crop. The sugar industry is just starting to get back on its feet. We have a small-crop horticultural industry that is worth close on $400 million and, hopefully, this year the sugar industry will be worth $200 million. This legislation and the government’s prolonged dysfunctional management of our natural resources and vegetation have had an adverse effect on the Burnett’s primary producers, as witnessed by correspondence to me from an avocado and lychee farmer. She states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Dear Rob, I would like to bring to your attention the remnant vegetation moratorium. We own an avocado orchard right on the edge of Childers--our status has been changed from white to blue. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

<A ID="pgfId-1099241"></A>

That letter was sent to me by Donna Duncan. Mrs Donna Duncan OAM is a respected, decorated, valued and honoured Australian who has worked hard all her life on the land. Donna is not prone to sudden emotional outbursts and, after almost 40 years of farming, has learnt patience. When Donna writes to me in relation to this government’s vegetation management and regrowth clearing moratorium saying, ‘This government is really very, very dangerous. Hitler eat your heart out,’ I listen very carefully. Before members make any judgements on her comments, I invite them to very carefully consider her story. Perhaps they might like to reflect on the level of desperation and frustration which would cause someone who is the salt of the earth to write that sort of statement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099260"></A>
For people who are not from the country, for people who live in South-East Queensland cities and think of themselves as friends of the environment, the Bligh government’s vegetation moratorium sounded as though it would protect the environment and was reasonable government policy. However, when you listen and talk to farmers--people like Donna Duncan who have been seriously affected by this unexpected and sudden Labor ban on clearing regrowth--‘reasonable’ is not a word that is used to describe this government’s actions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099261"></A>
The Duncan family own and work an avocado orchard on the edge of the Burnett town of Childers. Their property was coloured white on the vegetation maps so that if they wanted to they could legally clear their farm of regrowth or selectively cut back undergrowth. However, there was no need to clear remnant vegetation because, as Donna says, ‘This property has been an orchard for close to 40 years and prior to that it was a cane farm, apparently one of the best in the Isis for 100 years. It has no remnant native vegetation.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099262"></A>
After the Premier suddenly imposed her latest moratorium, Donna’s farm, with the stroke of the pen, changed overnight to blue so that it became illegal to clear any regrowth. At the beginning of this month it appeared that it also had become illegal to cut back any tree, including the Duncan’s avocado trees. At the end of September, Donna said to me, ‘We understand that at present we are actually breaking the law by simply pruning our trees. If we don’t prune them and maintain them, we will lose them and our income and we don’t want to go to jail.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099263"></A>
Once Mrs Duncan’s plight became public, this government was forced to act. The minister made his director-general clarify in a recent letter to the editor in relation to Donna’s truthful and legitimate criticisms. However, in his letter, the director-general admitted, ‘Satellite imagery was used to make regrowth maps and sometimes non-native tree cover, like orchards of different trees, is mistakenly interpreted as native vegetation. This is an inevitable consequence of satellite imagery.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099265"></A>
Unfortunately for our hardworking rural producers, this is also an inevitable consequence of a government which is desperate to appease the green movement. The other inevitable consequence of this government’s vegetation management laws is the total destruction of people’s civil liberties, rights and freedoms. With this legislation, once again, farmers are right where Queensland Labor politicians want them--demonised, made to feel guilty and now having to prove their innocence. By admission, the director-general of the department of environment said that even their detection methods are seriously flawed. That is like the government saying that they find you guilty of murder while admitting that nobody is reported missing or they do not even have a body and their only ‘star’ eye witness who placed you at the scene of the crime is deaf, dumb and blind, but you are still guilty because they think you look like a murderer. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099266"></A>
The situation that Mrs Duncan found herself in is typical of the dysfunction, confusion and injustice. Donna Duncan did not even know whether she could legally prune her own avocado trees after the government slapped its election moratorium on regrowth clearing and declared her farm ‘blue’. After many media articles on Donna’s predicament, the natural resources minister was forced to act and ordered his department’s director-general to respond. He cleared up the situation for about 30 seconds, or for as long as it took Donna Duncan to examine the new vegetation management maps covering her farm from the government website. The new government maps now show another colour change to the vegetation on her property.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099268"></A>
First it was ‘white’, indicating non-remnant vegetation. Then it was ‘blue’, preventing any clearing of regrowth. Now it is ‘pink’--and it is not the pop singer P!nk. This is the ‘pink’ that breaks your heart, wipes tens of thousands of dollars off your property values and stops you from sustainably managing your farm and vegetation. It is the ‘pink’, according to the government, which is ‘high-value regrowth containing endangered regional ecosystems’. Donna, more than likely now, has to spend a lot of money to prove to this government and this bureaucracy that her avocado trees and lychee trees are not high-value regrowth containing endangered regional ecosystems. This is just one of the examples of the madness and the damage suffered by honest, decent, hardworking Queensland families because this government, in an act of political desperation, decided to fiddle with the vegetation laws in order to bribe and politically buy green voting preferences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099270"></A>
Donna Duncan unfortunately will have to pay most probably $320 for a PMAV and then at least another $600 plus for an environmental scientist to prove that the government maps are wrong. This is nothing more than a rort. It amounts to government sanctioned corruption and extortion. When Mrs Duncan questioned a hapless government bureaucrat about the accuracy of the new maps, he made the excuse that ‘the vegetation maps were based on pre-white settlement and that the Isis was a huge scrub’, to which Donna correctly remarked, ‘I do not understand what he is talking about. There were no satellites pre-white settlement.’ </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1099279"></A>
Parcel land number two has a band of blue with only two gum trees within it. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1099280"></A>
I think when you look at the Mapping what has happened, is the boundaries have drifted, as our fence line outside the property has trees everywhere on the road reserve and with satellite imagery errors become big.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1099281"></A>
The moratorium is to be lifted on the 7th of October. Following paying all of this money we might now have our land put back to white with out the expense but if not we will have to Maybe pay more money as they will otherwise proceed to lock in the blue.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1099282"></A>
All very confusing as even the Consultant hasn’t a clue what is going to happen, and cannot advise now. As originally she has almost promised that the blue would revert to white again following paying the money and the application being lodged. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099283"></A>
In closing, nothing this government does makes sense. Due process is always a casualty of this political war to win green voting preferences in Brisbane. Donna Duncan and her fellow Queensland farmers are not the criminals that this government tries to make out they are. The Premier says that she only wants to create jobs and wealth, but her actions, especially in regard to vegetation management, cause the opposite. In the Burnett, like the rest of Queensland, these unfair laws have caused much economic loss, hurt, anger and confusion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099286"></A>
I would like to remind the House that there was an article by Mark Phelps titled ‘How Bligh is killing farmers’. In that article he quoted straight-talking AgForce cattle president, Grant Maudsley. He delivered a damning assessment of the Bligh government’s handling of vegetation management. Towards the end of the article, Mr Maudsley said that fresh food is endangered under the proposed regime. He said, ‘The fact is that food prices will increase when the supply of food declines because production area is limited--green preference deals come at a significant price to Queensland farmers as well as consumers.’ I unequivocally oppose this legislation. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Adjustments to the rights of property owners that are made through this bill are not uncommon, because all property owners, whether they be freehold owners or leaseholders of rural lands that contain important vegetation--vegetation that is important to protect--are subject to a balancing of rights. That is what this bill aims to achieve and does achieve, and it is what the entire framework of the government’s vegetation management has sought to achieve in its various incarnations over time which have, contrary to the assertions of members opposite, been based on science and scientific evidence and new understandings of best practice in land management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099328"></A>
It is very sad and unfortunate that members opposite have in the debate on this legislation--as they did on the Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Bill that we debated last sittings, both pieces of legislation which they are opposed to--characterised the debate in the divisive way that they have, as if this government is targeting rural people with unfair, arbitrary and draconian measures. I think it has been acknowledged by speakers on both sides that the vast majority of rural landholders do have a strong and economic interest in pursuing good and best practice land management. As is the case in most fields of government regulation and legislation, unfortunately sometimes regulations and legislation have to be introduced and enforced to catch those people who, whether through misfortune, ignorance, economic circumstance or whatever reason, do not pursue best practice in land management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099330"></A>
That is what the scientists informed the government and others who are interested in the development of the Great Barrier Reef Protection Amendment Bill--that many landholders were doing their best to adopt practices that would reduce sediment and pesticide residue run-off into the Great Barrier Reef. But all of the good effort and the investment by many people could be so rapidly and quickly undone by the actions of a few. That is why it was necessary, in order to maintain the good condition of our Great Barrier Reef, which is so critical to the economy of our nation, our state and our regions, for the government to introduce those measures to improve the quality of water running off into the Great Barrier Reef lagoon. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099332"></A>
This legislation also includes a component to support that by protecting regrowth vegetation in riparian areas in priority reef catchments, one of those being the Wet Tropics region. I support that because, along with the member for Hinchinbrook, as I have mentioned in the House before, earlier this year I flew over the reef catchments. By air it is very easy to see just how significant the damage is in our watercourses in the reef catchments, where vegetation has been denuded to the very edge of those watercourses.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099336"></A>
There is no part of this debate which seeks to put blame. What we as a community have to do is ensure that those practices that did cause damage and which the community at large, as well as individuals, is paying to repair does not occur again in the future. All around the country we are now dealing with the consequences of poor land management practices in the past, many of which, if not a substantial majority, were in relation to clearing of native vegetation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099337"></A>
We need to remember in this debate that in protecting regrowth vegetation we need to consider exactly what regrowth is. It is vegetation that was cleared, and for whatever reason the landholders, whether they be those who undertook the clearing or those who have taken over the properties since, have not turned into productive land. We have cleared so much native vegetation that that which is left, whether it be regrowth or original vegetation, is critical to protect. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099339"></A>
This legislation seeks to achieve, and I believe does achieve, a balance between the rights and interests of landholders and the community at large. Hundreds, if not thousands, of landholders are investing their time and their money in revegetating their waterways and riparian corridors, and we as a community are spending public funds through various levels of government--all three levels of government--in engaging with landholders and the community in revegetation projects right throughout the country, particularly along watercourses, because we now know how critical they are not only in protecting water quality flowing into the Great Barrier Reef but also in preserving the ecosystems upon which ultimately the productive capacity of the land depends. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099342"></A>
In the last couple of weeks evidence has emerged that our native bird populations throughout the country have crashed. Hundreds and thousands of birds and individual species, the research is now showing, have disappeared, putting more species at risk of extinction and under threat. Birds are a very good indicator of the health of our ecosystems. Regrowth areas that are protected under this legislation are critical habitats for birds, which play a very important part in the health of our ecosystems and in the productive capacity of our lands. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099343"></A>
I think it is very sad that some members opposite have characterised this important debate in the way that they have. They have tried to characterise it as simply based on politics. It is much more important than that. It is based on an evolution of our understanding of the critical role that native vegetation plays in the health of our ecosystem and the health, ultimately, of the Great Barrier Reef. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1099344"></A>
I support the provisions of this bill. There has been extensive public consultation during the development of the legislation. The moratorium was introduced to allow the government to consult with key stakeholder groups without the risk of pre-emptive clearing of high-value regrowth vegetation. The public was invited to make submissions on the control of the regrowth clearing, either directly to the Department of Environment and Resource Management or through key stakeholder groups who could represent their concerns. The department received some 386 submissions, 78 per cent of which were from rural landholders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103595"></A>
Considerable consultation was also undertaken with peak industry groups such as AgForce, the Queensland Farmers Federation, the World Wildlife Fund, the Wilderness Society, Wildlife Queensland and the Queensland Conservation Council including a ministers round table, which met twice with stakeholders. Organisations such as Meat &amp; Livestock Australia, the Canegrowers Association, Timber Queensland, the Local Government Association of Queensland, the Real Estate Institute of Queensland, the Urban Development Institute of Australia, the Queensland Indigenous Working Group and Cement, Concrete and Aggregates Australia were also consulted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103603"></A>
To gauge the possible impacts of regrowth measures on lending decisions made by financial institutions, consultation was undertaken with the Australian Bankers Association and the Australian Finance Conference as well agribusiness representatives from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the National Australia Bank, the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Westpac Banking Corporation, Suncorp Metway, Elders and Rabobank. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103605"></A>
As we have heard, the minister has visited rural properties around the state with AgForce representatives to see firsthand the issues landholders face when managing regrowth vegetation. As a result of those consultations significant changes have been made to the final form of the bill. That is right and proper because it has been a genuine process, one that strove to achieve a proper balance between the rights of landholders and the community interest in preserving regrowth vegetation not for its own sake, not just for political purposes, but because ultimately our entire society depends on our ability to protect our ecosystems and protect the productive quality of the land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103610"></A>
I am sure, contrary to the assertions that have been made by some members opposite in this debate, that ultimately the value of the land that contains protected vegetation is going to be enhanced. There are a number of ways in which that will occur, not the least of which is under the regime that is likely to operate in the future based around a carbon economy. The preservation and existence of native vegetation on lands is going to add value to those properties. The community certainly places a very high value on the protection of what is left of native vegetation in this state after decades and decades of indiscriminate clearing. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr RYAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Morayfield--ALP) (6.21 pm): I rise to speak in support of the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. I would like to start by noting that this bill is about protecting the lifestyles of Queenslanders and about fulfilling commitments--commitments made at the last election and commitments made when the moratorium legislation passed the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103613"></A>
The commitment made when the moratorium legislation passed the House was a commitment to consult. I have received feedback from not only members of my community but also industry groups that that commitment has been fulfilled. They appreciated the thorough and genuine consultation process undertaken by the minister and the department. To a large extent, they were grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this very important legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103614"></A>
I would also like to note the overwhelming contribution from members of my community, the community of the Morayfield state electorate. The people of the Morayfield state electorate care a lot about the environment. They particularly care about their lifestyles. There is a lot of native vegetation in the Morayfield area. People are concerned about the future of that native vegetation. The people of the Morayfield area will welcome this legislation. They will welcome the legislation because it provides certainty and protection of their lifestyles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103615"></A>
I would like to address how the new measures contained in this bill will apply to regrowth vegetation and how this differs from the moratorium and the previous vegetation management framework. Queensland currently has approximately 80 million hectares of native woody vegetation fully protected under the current vegetation management framework. The previous framework provided protection to remnant vegetation on freehold land and about 300,000 hectares of mature regrowth vegetation on agricultural and grazing leasehold land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103616"></A>
The recent regrowth clearing moratorium temporarily extended protection to endangered regrowth and woody native vegetation within 50 metres of watercourses in the priority reef catchments of the Great Barrier Reef. This bill will amend the Vegetation Management Act to allow for the long-term regulation of clearing of high-value regrowth across Queensland and in buffer areas adjoining watercourses flowing into the Great Barrier Reef. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103619"></A>
The new regrowth arrangements extend the regulation of mature regrowth from leasehold land to include Indigenous and freehold land and will protect the highest value regrowth vegetation--that is endangered, of-concern and least-concern. Vegetation that is subject to the new regrowth arrangements is identified on a regrowth map which covers about 3.7 million hectares of regrowth vegetation. About 1.4 million hectares of the regrowth vegetation that is shown on the regrowth map has been locked in as category X on certified property maps of assessable vegetation, PMAVs, and is not affected by the new measures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103620"></A>
The new regrowth regulations apply to a total of 2.3 million hectares which is subject to minimum standards and best land management practices under the new code. Of this, the code will protect from clearing about one million hectares of regrowth which was not previously protected. The map covers regrowth vegetation on all tenures, but the legislation will only affect non-urban freehold and Indigenous land and agricultural and grazing leasehold land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103621"></A>
Consistent with the current Vegetation Management Act, only clearing of native woody vegetation is affected. Therefore, grasslands, mangroves and non-native plants including orchards will continue to not be regulated under this act. An important difference to the moratorium arrangements is that the new map only includes regrowth that has not been cleared since 31 December 1989--that is, the vegetation is more than 20 years old. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103623"></A>
In discussions, landholders identified real concerns with the moratorium capturing areas that are regularly cleared on a five- to eight-year cycle to maintain production on fertile country. That consultation process was important to the drafting of this bill. I am pleased that the government listened to landholders and ensured that these productive lands are not affected by this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103626"></A>
Landholders will be able to identify areas affected by the proposed amendments by referring to a regrowth vegetation map which shows high-value regrowth vegetation and particular watercourses in the priority reef catchments. These maps can be downloaded free of charge from the department’s website. To manage this regrowth vegetation on their land, landholders will not have to obtain a permit from the department. A landholder’s only obligation is to notify the department of their intention to clear regrowth and to conduct clearing in accordance with the regrowth vegetation code. The notification process ensures the department is aware of the location, which will assist the department in monitoring compliance with the regrowth code. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103631"></A>
On freehold land the code protects endangered vegetation as well as of-concern and least-concern vegetation near watercourses and wetlands on steep slopes or on areas that provide essential habitat for threatened species. On leasehold agricultural and grazing land the code protects endangered, of-concern and least-concern vegetation on wetlands and watercourses in essential habitat areas or on steep slopes. Other than essential habitat areas, these requirements are consistent with the current vegetation management arrangements for leasehold land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103634"></A>
The moratorium arrangements applying to all native woody vegetation within 50 metres of watercourses in the high-priority reef catchments will be carried over to the new regrowth arrangements. The only difference is that improved watercourse mapping will be used to identify these watercourses. This includes stream order numbering on the map to make it easier for landholders to manage vegetation under the regrowth vegetation code. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103639"></A>
These arrangements under the code represent the minimum standard for landholders to achieve. The code also provides guidelines for landholders to achieve best management practice. I acknowledge that the majority of landholders are already achieving that best management practice benchmark. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103644"></A>
This government has kept its word and landholders will continue to have certainty, with PMAVs lodged during the moratorium. These maps lock in category X areas and give landholders certainty to manage vegetation in these areas without requiring approval under the Vegetation Management Act. PMAVs provided certainty under the old vegetation framework, under the moratorium and will continue to do so under this bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1103647"></A>
I would like to conclude my remarks by commending the minister, his staff, the department and the community members who participated in the consultation process for their respective contributions. This bill strikes the right balance between protection of regrowth with the highest biodiversity value and ensuring landholders can continue to manage productive land. This bill is about doing what is right for both the protection of biodiversity in Queensland and continued responsible land use for Queensland. This bill provides certainty and I commend it to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (7.30 pm): I present a bill for an act to refer particular matters relating to workplace relations to the Parliament of the Commonwealth for the purposes of section 51(xxxvii) of the Commonwealth Constitution, to amend other legislation to provide for particular matters as a consequence of the referral and for associated matters, and to amend the Trustee Companies Act 1968 to facilitate the regulation of trustee companies by the Commonwealth, to repeal the Trustee Companies Regulation 1996 and to make particular consequential amendments to other acts relating to trustee companies, and to amend the Adoption Act 2009 to provide for a particular matter, and to authorise the Governor to make a gazette notice endorsing a particular Commonwealth regulation for the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition (Queensland) Act 2003 and to amend the Mutual Recognition (Queensland) Act 1992 for a particular purpose.

The purpose of the bill before the House is to refer to the Commonwealth the state’s industrial relations powers for the private sector. This bill also sets out the conditions under which Queensland makes this referral to ensure Queenslanders the best result under the national industrial relations system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108354"></A>
Clauses 5 and 6 of the Fair Work (Commonwealth Powers) and Other Provisions Bill 2009 allow the Commonwealth to legislate exclusively with respect to all employers in Queensland, with the exception of state and local government. The bill provides for the national system to cover all the private sector and some commercial elements of the public sector including government owned corporations. The Queensland system will continue to cover the 300,000 employees in the state Public Service and local government, including the Brisbane City Council and local government owned corporations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108355"></A>
The Queensland government has not taken this step lightly and not without extensive consultation with Queensland employers and unions. The current state industrial relations system, embodied in the Industrial Relations Act 1999, has fairly balanced the interests of employers and employees. However, a national system can achieve comparable results, and that is why Queensland has taken the step to refer state’s power on this issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108356"></A>
This bill is the result of significant negotiations with the federal government on a range of issues. The Queensland government has been clear that several conditions need be met to ensure the security of Queensland workers as part of the referral of power. Importantly, the referral of state power is cast in such terms as to prevent the Commonwealth from unilaterally changing the scope of the national system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108357"></A>
The bill includes provisions which limit the Commonwealth from making amendments to the national system laws which impact on Queensland’s referred jurisdiction without the agreement of the Queensland government. The Queensland government wanted Queensland workers to continue to have access to decent wages and conditions, collective representation and recourse against unfair dismissal. The move to the Fair Work Act at a federal level has allowed Queensland to achieve this through a national industrial relations system being fairer, less prescriptive and less complex than Work Choices. In the words of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1108358"></A>
The level of complexity created by competing state and federal workplace relations systems is a decades-old problem which has been thrown into sharp relief by our contemporary market economy. Replication, overlap and confusion between state and federal workplace regulation has become increasingly unsustainable.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108359"></A>
The bill comes at the end of a lengthy period of cooperation that nearly two years ago first saw industrial relations ministers from the states and the Commonwealth endorse broad principles under which states would continue to have an important ongoing role in the new national industrial relations system. A high-level officers group was then charged with the task of drawing up an intergovernmental agreement to assist in the process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108360"></A>
In an important step towards a national workplace relations system for the private sector, state and territory ministers unanimously endorsed a set of workplace relations principles, now outlined in clause 4 of the bill, that guide the development of a stable, uniform national system. By endorsing these principles, ministers endorsed a modern, fair and flexible workplace relations system. They expressed their commitment to a strong safety net of minimum standards, collective bargaining at the workplace level, protection from unfair dismissal and fair and effective remedies through an independent umpire. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108361"></A>
I am pleased to advise the House that these principles are enshrined in the Fair Work (Commonwealth Powers) and Other Provisions Bill 2009 and in the intergovernmental agreement which referring states have been asked to sign. I can announce that I will sign the intergovernmental agreement and advise the Commonwealth that Queensland will refer its powers to the Commonwealth. This will ensure that Queensland meets the deadline for the 1 January 2010 implementation of a national industrial relations system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108362"></A>
There were a number of very important issues that needed to be considered before Queensland gave agreement to the referral of power. Therefore, a number of conditions were sought on the referral, including--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1108363"></A>
•	the Queensland government having power to apply to Fair Work Australia to end industrial action in government owned corporations in specified circumstances; </Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1108364"></A>
•	preservation of Queensland’s unique and beneficial conditions for apprentices and trainees until Fair Work Australia reviews national conditions in this area; </Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1108365"></A>
•	protection of certain state entitlements of employees transferring to the national system, as outlined at clauses 30 to 44 of the bill; </Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1108366"></A>
•	preservation of certain award wage rates arising from Queensland Industrial Relations Commission decisions affecting the community and disability services sector; </Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1108367"></A>
•	a high degree of control and input by Queensland over changes to law and policy in the national system. </Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108368"></A>
The Commonwealth government has worked with Queensland on these issues and these conditions have been met through cooperation between state and federal officers. These conditions will be embodied in further Commonwealth transitional legislation relating to the referral.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108369"></A>
Other important amendments contained within part 4 of the bill provide for changes to the Trustee Companies Act 1968. Trustee companies are currently authorised to administer deceased estates under state and territory legislation. In Queensland, the Trustee Companies Act 1968 applies. The amendments in the bill implement the agreement of the March 2008 meeting of the Council of Australian Governments for the Commonwealth government to assume responsibility for the regulation of trustee companies by the end of 2009. In accordance with this COAG agreement, I present these amendments to the House so that Queensland can meet its obligations and ensure that a smooth transition to Commonwealth regulation occurs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108370"></A>
Commonwealth regulation of trustee companies is anticipated to have the advantages of providing modern, efficient and effective supervision of trustee companies; removing unnecessary regulatory burdens associated with the duplicate licensing and reporting requirements across jurisdictions; freeing up market entry mechanisms and promoting greater competition; and providing for better information and access to a more cost-effective and timely alternative dispute resolution mechanism.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108371"></A>
Accordingly, the amendments to the Trustee Companies Act 1968 in this bill remove the state approval mechanism for trustee companies and recognise licensed trustee companies within the meaning of section 601RAA of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cwlth); omit sections that will be unnecessary or inconsistent when Commonwealth regulation takes effect; facilitate the transfer of a trustee company’s business to another licensed trustee company when its licence is cancelled; and provide for the making of regulations of a transitional nature to facilitate the transition to national regulation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1108372"></A>
Beyond the amendments to the industrial relations arrangements in Queensland, the bill at parts 6 and 7 also provides an authorisation under the Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition (Queensland) Act 2003 for the Governor to make a gazette notice endorsing the regulations proposed under the Commonwealth Trans-Tasman Mutual Recognition Act 2003. The bill at clauses 110 and 111 will also amend the Mutual Recognition (Queensland) Act 1992 to allow the Governor to approve by proclamation the terms of amendments to the Commonwealth Mutual Recognition Act 1992.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112841"></A>
Section 9B prohibits the sale of prescribed drug paraphernalia, such as bongs and ice pipes, in South Australia. The granting of a permanent exemption under these Commonwealth acts requires the endorsement of all jurisdictions participating in the mutual recognition schemes. This bill enables Queensland to endorse the Commonwealth proposal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112842"></A>
Finally, the bill also includes a further unrelated amendment to the Adoption Act 2009. The amendment makes transitional arrangements for interim adoption orders that were made under the Adoption of Children Act 1964 and treats them as interim orders made under the Adoption Act 2009. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112843"></A>
As I have already outlined, the Rudd Labor government has been very cooperative in its dealings with Queensland and the other states and territories on the introduction of a national industrial relations system. The resulting system sets aside the Work Choices approach to industrial relations and restores the balance of power to best look after the interests of both employers and employees. There is no doubt that the referral of Queensland’s private sector industrial relations system to the federal jurisdiction will result in some changes to the work undertaken by industrial inspectors in Queensland. However, we are committed to ensuring a smooth transition to this new system and to making certain that employment security is protected. This bill today is a giant step forward in establishing a cooperative system that respects state rights, but also creates an overarching national industrial relations system which is in the best interests of business and workers. I commend the bill to the House. <Hansard-Speech-End>

I acknowledge in my contribution the impact that the procession of legislation in relation to vegetation management has had on rural landowners. I believe that the vast majority of landowners, particularly in the rural area, both on small acreage and larger acreage, are responsible landowners. It is counterproductive to their business plan to be less than responsible, especially in the area that is being talked about in this debate and that is the handling, dispensing and application of chemicals. Because people are now aware and educated about the impacts of run-off, I do not think there are many farmers who act irresponsibly. On top of that, there is an economic imperative in being careful in the administration of chemicals and fertilisers. I am a great supporter of organics. I think that would be a great direction for all farming to take. However, that is not what we are debating today. </Hansard-Body>

The member for Nicklin referred to the protection of the lifestyle of Queenslanders, as did other speakers. He noted that the cost to landowners for this legislation has been acknowledged by some, but there is no recognition or compensation for the cost of implementing the requirements of this and other vegetation management legislation. There is no recompense or compensation to landowners to implement those requirements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112852"></A>
I was at a family funeral a week ago and a person at the funeral came up to me and started talking about vegetation management and the cost and the complexity for farm owners to comply with government legislation. He acknowledged at the beginning of the conversation that it was probably not the place to do it and then continued to talk about it. He was not a landowner; he was a consultant. He is someone that the landowners have to employ for $10,000 to carry out mapping and prepare documentation for submission to government. As a consultant who probably earns a living in that area, he was concerned about how complex and costly this process has become. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112853"></A>
One of the previous government speakers challenged the view of many on the non-government side that this government has acted detrimentally in relation to rural landowners. There is no doubt that rural landowners feel victimised by the ALP government’s legislation. If one looks at some of the decisions made as they relate to farming land, I do not believe that an unbiased onlooker would be left with any other alternative than to hold this view. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112854"></A>
Something that is very topical at the moment is the threat of bushfires. In my electorate most of the big fire fronts come out of the national parks or the State Forest. Landowners do feel very disadvantaged in relation to government influence on their property and their land management. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112855"></A>
The bill puts into legislation a 50-metre buffer on creek banks. The member for Burdekin spoke at great length in relation to this. I agree with the point of view that in some areas 50 metres is far too wide and in other areas it is far too narrow. I think it is indicative of the approach that has been taken in relation to vegetation management that there has been, from the beginning of the vegetation management legislation, a broad-stroke approach without recognising the diversity of our land here in Queensland. Management practices in brigalow country in many instances were required over land that should be managed differently and vice versa. I do not think that too many people would argue about the need to protect creeks and look after the riparian regions, but there does have to be a practical approach to it in relation to appropriate management for each circumstance. </Hansard-Body>

The minister’s second reading speech states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1112858"></A>
The new regrowth regulations will cover about 3.7 million hectares of high-value regrowth and regrowth vegetation within 50 metres of watercourses in priority reef catchments. Approximately 1.4 million hectares of this is already locked in as category X areas on PMAVs and, as I have already mentioned, landholders will be able to continue to manage these areas without requiring approval. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1112859"></A>
Prior to the moratorium on clearing endangered regrowth, less than 240,000 hectares of regrowth vegetation were subject to regulations controlling clearing. The new laws will see an additional approximately one million hectares protected, with a total of 2.3 million hectares subject to minimum standards and best practice management under a code. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112860"></A>
I do believe that there are regions in our state that should be protected. I believe that it is critically important that areas of regional importance have appropriate protection. Overwhelmingly, however, in my electorate the sentiment has been expressed, particularly by people in rural and regional areas, is that this government, and perhaps previous state governments of a different political persuasion, need to look after the land that it already has in trust and to properly manage that land particularly at this time of the year in relation to hazard reduction. What happens is that these wonderfully diverse areas are protected, the hazard builds and there is a wildfire and we lose the lot. I visited New South Wales after the fires went through near the Blue Mountains and south of Sydney and what can be seen is that any biodiversity is gone. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1112861"></A>
The experience in my electorate is that the significant fire fronts come down out of national parks and state forests. Unless the government is able to expend money to manage the land that it already has entrusted to the Crown, it should not be adding to that area until it can be properly managed. That is generally the sentiment of people in my electorate. It is not so much the sentiment of the people who are urban based because they are not greatly at risk, but certainly those people who own acreage, 100 per cent of those people who own property that abut crown land and everyone who owns large grazing properties feel concerned that the government is adding to its landholding but is not investing sufficiently to manage that landholding. On that basis I will not support the legislation.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (7.49 pm), in reply: First of all, I thank all members who have participated in the debate today. The Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 will amend the act to allow for the long-term regulation of clearing of high-value regrowth across Queensland and within 50 metres of watercourses and priority catchments flowing into the Great Barrier Reef. It also streamlines the operation of the vegetation management framework and temporarily extends the current stay on the registration of title boundary plans under the Land Act 1994. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117311"></A>
With respect to regrowth vegetation, this bill will ensure that 2.3 million hectares are subject to the minimum standards of the regrowth vegetation code of which about one million hectares of the highest value regrowth vegetation will be protected from clearing altogether. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117312"></A>
Contrary to the comments made by the member for Callide, this bill is all about biodiversity and good land management--preventing clearing in endangered regrowth vegetation and habitat for threatened species on the slopes and adjacent to watercourses. Good land managers told us that they did not clear in these areas. Indeed, I think<Hansard-Italic>
 Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
 <Hansard-Italic>
Country Life</Hansard-Italic>
 reported it as a win. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117314"></A>
This legislation will also assist to deliver on the government’s commitment to protect the Great Barrier Reef by reducing sediments and pollutants flowing out to the reef. Outside of reef watercourses, regrowth that has not been cleared since 31 December 1989--that is, vegetation that is 20 years old or older--will be subject to the new arrangements. Because it is vegetation that has not been cleared since the 1989 alliance with the Kyoto protocol accounting requirements, the use of this date in defining high-value regrowth ensures that landholder participation in any future carbon offset scheme is unlikely to be affected by the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117317"></A>
I recognise the member for Callide for his support for responsible land management, including management of high-value areas and the concept of sustainability. Indeed, I would thank him for raising the issues that this bill directly addresses and the approach that this government took in developing this legislation to provide certainty, recognise the skills and ability of landholders to manage their land sustainably and achieve a proper balance between protection and production. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117319"></A>
Firstly, we consulted with landholders about how they managed their land and how they treat regrowth. Consequently, areas that have been regularly cleared to maintain production are not affected by this legislation, giving the certainty for future production. Similarly, landholders will be able to continue to clear regulated regrowth vegetation for most property management activities that are already exempt under the Integrated Planning Act. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117322"></A>
The certainty provided by existing PMAVs is also maintained. It is true that assurances were given to landholders by me in 2004 and, as a result, landholders will be able to continue to manage vegetation shown as a category X area on a PMAV as they see fit. Already more than 5,800 landholders have locked in their vegetation through PMAVs and another 1,400 are currently in assessment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117325"></A>
Importantly, in recognition of their skills and abilities, landholders are able to apply the new code and manage their properties consistent with the regrowth code without having to wait for permits for clearing regrowth. Landholders simply need to notify the department of their intention to clear regrowth to which the code applies. This recognises that the majority of farmers are doing the right thing with their regrowth and are able to apply the requirements themselves without going through an application and approval process--something that members opposite have been on to us about for years. Yet once we actually do it, they continue to oppose the legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117327"></A>
The new regrowth laws strike the right balance by protecting vital regrowth with high biodiversity values while allowing landholders to continue to sustainably manage their property. It is somewhat surprising that some LNP members claim not to have seen the code when it has been on my department’s website for the last two weeks. In fact, there have been some 21,000 downloads of the code on top of the 7,000 regrowth map downloads since 8 October. I simply say that the LNP needs to keep up. To help them with that onerous task of downloading from my department’s website I table a copy of the <Hansard-Italic>
Landholders’ guide to the regrowth management code</Hansard-Italic>
 for their assistance. </Hansard-Body>

High-value regrowth and regrowth watercourses in reef catchments are shown on the new regrowth map. The new map is improved and takes better account of towns and suburbs and orchards, crops and plantations. The mapping may still contain some areas of orchards or other vegetation that is clearly not high-value regrowth. If there is an error in the map, the department will create a PMAV free of charge to correct the error. These errors are an inevitable consequence of satellite imagery, which is why I have ensured that maps and the law work together. If the vegetation is not native regrowth vegetation, the laws do not apply. Therefore, orchards are not captured by the new requirements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117333"></A>
Before I leave this, let me assure honourable members about avocados. We all love our Queensland avocados, but we do know that they are not native vegetation. This bill relates to native vegetation. I say this for the benefit of the member for Burnett, who has raised this issue in the media on several occasions. Despite the government advising that only native vegetation is affected and orchards are exempt in their own right, he continues to spread misinformation. Officers from the department have spoken with his constituent, Mrs Duncan, and similarly advised her that her avocado orchards are not captured by the regrowth provisions and she has indicated that she understands this. It is true that her avocado trees were mapped and the department has prepared a PMAV, a property map of assessable vegetation, for her which will be delivered to her this week at a meeting with my parliamentary secretary, the member for Capalaba. In fact, I saw a copy of this earlier tonight. There is no charge for a PMAV that corrects an error in the mapping. There is no consultant’s fee. There is no $320 charge. There is no constraint on her avocado plantation. Mrs Duncan can keep producing and we can keep enjoying her avocados. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117336"></A>
The department is aware of some other landholders in relation to whom there are mapping inconsistencies and is similarly moving to address this. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1117340"></A>
This bill also presents a range of reforms to streamline operation of the Vegetation Management Act 1999 based on client feedback and operational experience over the last five years under the current framework. One of these reforms seeks to streamline mapping arrangements for landholders in the department. In doing so, it provides a single process for finetuning and amending vegetation management maps at a property scale using our PMAVs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117343"></A>
Contrary to the member for Callide advising the House that all appeal rights are removed in this legislation supporting the new PMAV process, there are new internal review and appeal processes for specific decisions under the VMA, including PMAV decisions. While the regrowth map itself is not appealable to ensure that other landholders are not affected at a property level, a landholder can challenge a decision through a PMAV. These new processes ultimately apply for appeal to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal. These review and appeal provisions complement the existing provisions that provide for the review and appeal of decisions for development assessment, concurrence applications and compliance notices. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117347"></A>
Also raised by the member for Callide was the issue of civil liberties--a curious notion coming from someone from the former National Party--relating to a number of issues set out by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. I might clarify for the member that the clause the committee entitled ‘Compulsory acquisition of property’ relates to ownership of trees that are required to be planted on state land as part of a restoration notice related to unauthorised clearing. It ensures that the ownership of those trees is differentiated from trees planted for a lawful purpose on leasehold land such as farm forestry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117348"></A>
The Scrutiny of Legislation Committee identified issues arising from examination of the bill and outlined the way in which the explanatory notes addressed these amendments. The only issue that the committee invited me as minister to provide information on related to clause 27 and consultation undertaken prior to the introduction of the bill. My response to the committee advised that clause 27 updates section 22A of the VMA, removing some redundant provisions and updating terminology and renumbering the provision. This section includes reference to clearing in a registered area of agriculture and a wild rivers high-preservation area. As part of the consultation on future protection of regrowth vegetation undertaken during the moratorium, I conducted two round table meetings of stakeholder groups to which representatives of QIWG were invited. Additionally, the Department of Environment and Resource Management contacted QIWG seeking information regarding the effects on Indigenous interests and future protection of regrowth vegetation. I received no submissions from QIWG. However, the new regrowth arrangements do not significantly affect Indigenous land as this land is predominantly remnant vegetation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117350"></A>
Clearing for development on Indigenous land is specifically provided for under the Cape York Peninsula Heritage Act 2007--a matter that I referred to earlier today in this House in response to some allegations made in some national publications. The clearing of regrowth vegetation is subject to the same regulation as applies to other land tenures. Clearing under these arrangements is not prohibited but, rather, the highest-value vegetation is protected. Traditional rights enabling the use of vegetation for traditional purposes are not affected by this legislation. Collectively, these and other reforms detailed earlier will clarify and simplify the administration of the vegetation management legislation, making it more efficient for clients while ensuring that the purposes of the VMA continue to be achieved. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117389"></A>
Another key element to this bill relates to the stay on registrations of tidal boundary plans. The bill seeks to temporarily extend the stay for a further six months so that work in developing a solution to the issues around tidal boundaries can be completed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117390"></A>
During the consideration in detail stage of the debate on the Vegetation and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009, I will move a number of amendments. These amendments ensure the policy intent of the bill is delivered. I now formally table the explanatory notes to the amendments that will be moved during the consideration in detail stage of the debate. </Hansard-Body>

I will spend some time discussing the contributions of members opposite. During the course of the debate tonight--and I mentioned this earlier--we have seen the death of the old Liberal Party. Not one former Liberal has sat in this House during the debate. Of the 15 former members of the Liberal Party only one had the guts to turn up to this debate and make a contribution. Curiously enough, that member was the shadow spokesperson on climate change. What was his contribution? To oppose measures to stop the clearing of more trees in Queensland! Can there be a more pathetic stance? Where were the other 14 members of the LNP who were members of the Liberal Party? Where were the 14 cowardly Libs? Where were the 14 cowering Libs? Where were the 14 capitulating Libs? Where were the 14 causeless Libs? Where were the 14 clueless Libs? They were nowhere to be seen! Not only were they bullied by the knuckle-draggers from the National Party into submission and told to oppose this bill, but they were also bullied to the extent that they have not even come into this chamber during the six hours that we have been debating this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117393"></A>
Can there be a greater demonstration of how the once-mighty Liberal Party has fallen? In years gone by that once proud institution actually supported our controls on vegetation management in this state. Where are they now? We can only come to one conclusion, which is that the LNP was not an amalgamation of two parties but, rather, a takeover by the Nats of the Libs. Even now, as I summarise the bill in this chamber, not one member of the former Liberal Party sits in this chamber. There can be no more graphic demonstration of just how irrelevant that party has become in this state. </Hansard-Body>

When the next election comes around and we outline our election commitments and our campaigns in Cleveland, Indooroopilly, Coomera, Redlands, Kawana, Aspley, Mudgeeraba, Buderim, Mermaid Beach, Moggill, Currumbin, Surfers Paradise, Caloundra and Clayfield, we will say to the people of those electorates, ‘Guess what your former Liberal member did? They failed to stand up for the protection of the environment in Queensland.’ At the next election the choice will be stark: vote for Labor and protect your environment or vote for the LNP and let the knuckle-draggers of the National Party loose. That is the message of tonight’s debate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117395"></A>
And where were the leaders of the LNP? Where was the member for Surfers Paradise, who should have been defending the policy that was forced on him by the member for Southern Downs, the member for Callide and the other Neanderthals of the National Party? He was missing in action! </Hansard-Body>

Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your protection from such rudeness. Where was the member for Surfers Paradise, who is supposed to lead the charge against the laws that we are imposing on the people of Queensland? He was nowhere to be seen. Why? Because he is more concerned about his own backyard than he is about leadership. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117400"></A>
Of course, the central theme of the old National Party has been that this is the eighth time that we have debated vegetation management laws in the past decade. I am proud to say that I have been a part of most of those debates over the past decade. It occurs to me to wonder whether, when election time comes around, they ever go to the people of Queensland with a policy that says, ‘Vote for us and we will wind back these laws’? No, not ever! Not once has that happened in the four elections that I have been a part of as Minister for Natural Resources when vegetation management reform has been introduced. Why? Because they cannot risk it! They cannot risk offending the environmentalists and others who care about our environment any more than they already have. The rank hypocrisy of the silence of the Liberal and National Parties in the lead-up to an election day knows no bounds. I have not yet heard the member for Callide or his leader of the day stand up during an election campaign and say, ‘Vote for us and we will wind back these laws.’ Not once. Therein lies the hypocrisy that will bury them in irrelevance from today to the day that they are thrown out of this place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117401"></A>
When the Labor Party goes to an election, we enunciate what we are going to do and people vote accordingly. The level of dishonesty that is apparent in the Liberal National Party as it struggles internally to get any semblance of a progressive environmental policy knows no bounds. This may be the eighth occasion that we have brought vegetation management laws into this parliament, but it is also the eighth occasion on which the National Party has opposed every sensible reform to protect our environment in a carbon constrained economy. Tonight’s debate demonstrates just how the Nationals have overtaken the Liberals, which has reached a point of conservative irrelevance. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117402"></A>
Welcome! Finally a former Liberal member has entered the chamber, just as I am about to sit down. Unfortunately she has missed the best part of the debate. I say this to her: come election time, we will be in her electorate and we will tell people how she votes tonight. We will be telling the constituents of the member’s electorate how she votes tonight. The good people of Mudgeeraba need to know that when push came to shove in terms of protecting the precious environment of the Gold Coast hinterland, their member was nowhere to be seen. She was cowered, she was clueless, she was cowardly, she was capitulating and she was causeless when it came to protecting our environment. The people of Mudgeeraba will be told this repeatedly from now until election day. We stand proudly on our record of protecting the environment. The Libs now stand for nothing. They exist nowhere. As of tonight in Queensland we say ‘RIP’ to the Liberal Party. We may as well lose the L from LNP because the good old boys are back in town. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In addressing clause 6, I wanted to reiterate some points that I made in the second reading debate. Clause 6 is the first of a number of clauses that give an opportunity to present examples of situations that are the cause of the concern that I tried to express to the minister in the second reading debate. It is somewhat disappointing that the minister in his summing-up chose to revert to type. He chose to revert to the same slanderous dishonesty that we have seen each time this vegetation management question has been debated in the parliament. As I said in my contribution, I think the issue is more important than that. I think the issue is one that should be addressed on sound science, on fact and on logic, rather than reverting to type with the sort of meaningless rant that we heard from the minister at the conclusion of his summation of the second reading debate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1117444"></A>
The particular part of clause 6 that I wanted to refer to at the outset of consideration in detail is subdivision 2, which relates to the offsets policy. The offsets policy is a proposition, if you like, which allows landholders to offset a certain amount of clearing with other areas. The offsets policy, as it is outlined in sections 10C and 10D, is a very good example of the sort of subjectivity that has been the basis of the concern that I have tried to express about this legislation. That subjectivity occurs in a whole range of other areas within the legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122439"></A>
I would put it to the minister in consideration of this particular clause that the offsets policy that is outlined there is wide open to interpretation by particular officers with particular philosophical points of view who, despite the assurances the minister might give to this House, are able to impose upon landholders conditions or requirements on development applications which may not be reasonable. I would ask the minister to inform the parliament and the people of Queensland, and landholders especially, what checks and balances there are in regard to this particular part of the legislation to ensure that landholders do get a fair go, that they are not subject to that unbridled administrative power that was referred to by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. What avenues do individual landholders have to contest decisions that may be made in relation to the offsets that are required?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122442"></A>
It is one thing for the minister to adopt a policy that he says stems from his good intentions--which I have no doubt the minister will say this is--but it is another thing altogether to have that policy interpreted on the ground by a range of individual officers in a range of individual situations. One of the basic requirements of the application of those types of regulatory policies is that the people affected by them should have some right of appeal. They should have some protection from an unreasonable application that may not be at all in line with what was anticipated by the minister when he drew up this policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122443"></A>
I would like to hear from the minister tonight. I would like the minister to put on record for the people who will be dealing with the application of this policy how the government envisages this offset policy working initially. Does it apply to the clearing of remnant vegetation as well as to the clearing of the regrowth that is the subject of this bill? How are those decisions that are involved in the subjective application of this policy able to be tested by landholders? What protections are available to landholders from the possibility of the misapplication of this offsets policy? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 One of the problems of debates such as this, as we discovered when I summed up the second reading stage, is that more often than not members opposite do not bother to maintain a contemporary understanding of very useful publications that are produced by my department to help landholders, and even members of parliament, understand what provisions of legislation provide for. That is why I took the opportunity to table the <Hansard-Italic>
Landholders’ guide to the regrowth vegetation code</Hansard-Italic>
, which is referred to throughout this legislation. It is a simple English guide to what this legislation provides for, including the rights of landholders to make amendments to PMAVs and challenge decisions that are made. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122448"></A>
The other thing I would mention is that in the eight years that the member for Callide and I have been debating this type of legislation the song remains the same: the constant demonising of good, hardworking officers from my department continues. We have heard it yet again tonight. It is an old favourite. But I recall very well my visit to brigalow country around Emerald and Rolleston a couple of months ago. I paid particular attention to asking the landholders who I met how their relationship was with my department. I asked them in confidence, in private, and without exception each of those landholders said to me, ‘Your officers are very good. They work hard. They provide us with clear advice. If we have a problem, we know that we can ring them, and more often than not changes occur to vegetation maps or what have you.’ </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122450"></A>
The simple fact is--and I know that this is something the member for Burnett will find very difficult to understand--that if a landholder has a problem all they need to do is take that up with the officer concerned. If that does not reach a satisfactory resolution, they can elevate it right up to writing to me. As we have seen tonight, that does deliver results where a legitimate case exists. I am not expecting a thankyou from you, member for Burnett, but I know that your constituent has all the way through been given every consideration of her particular problem. I think the member for Callide, with respect, because he is a fair person, would recognise that my department has tried always to help that particular individual. That is the way we go about our business. If there is a problem with one particular officer, and there always is in any organisation, then we want to know about it because that gives us the ability to rectify it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122452"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I note from the minister’s answer that there is no formal right of appeal to the application of this offsets policy, and that is the very point that I have been endeavouring to make throughout the consideration of this bill, and so it is in a whole range of areas that we will come to in the consideration in detail stage as we go through. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122454"></A>
The minister makes much of the response that he apparently received from landholders who he approached in Emerald about the good relations that they had with officers of his department. Can I say to the minister that I think there are as many examples of bad relationships as well. The ‘tree police’, as they are colloquially known throughout Queensland, have established themselves as not being landholders’ favourite government officers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1122455"></A>
What we have to do when we draft legislation such as this is provide protection for all situations that may be involved. We should not assume when we draft legislation such as this that there are not going to be officers within a department who are going to insist on less than reasonable applications of this policy. Like so many other things within this legislation, it concerns me that the application of this offsets policy is subjective. What is required of landholders in terms of meeting the requirements of this offset policy is essentially a decision for an individual officer on the ground who may or may not be reasonable, who may or may not have a reasonable understanding of the offsets policy, and who may or may not have an understanding that is in line with the minister or the government of the day. Like so many other things in this vegetation management legislation, it is open and subject to the decisions of individuals on the ground who I know, in some cases, are driven by particular philosophies. That is the difficulty. That is the issue that the minister has no response to. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127144"></A>
Before we leave the consideration of this clause, I wanted to ask the minister to clarify the application of the offsets policy in relation to both remnant vegetation and regrowth vegetation. I alluded to that in my first contribution to the consideration of this clause. Can I ask the minister to clarify how the contents of this offset policy apply to remnant vegetation? Are there provisions to allow landholders to make decisions about offsetting particular areas? Are there any differences in relation to remnant vegetation and regrowth vegetation in the application of the offsets policy? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127146"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Perhaps I will answer the second question first because I think that will help in how we might resolve the member’s problem with the first issue. Yes, there is a difference in terms of the application of the offsets policy. The offsets policy applies to remnant vegetation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127147"></A>
Regrowth vegetation is self-assessable so the problem that the member mentioned as part of his first question about overzealous officers interpreting the provisions in a certain way for whatever ideological bent they may have does not apply. That is something that those opposite have called for in years gone by--that is, give the power to the landholders to manage their own properties according to some established guidelines. That is what we have done. The offsets code does not apply to regrowth vegetation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127149"></A>
In terms of remnant vegetation it does apply but it is not correct to say that landholders do not have appeal rights. What that code brings up is recognition under the IPA and there are certain appeal rights under the IPA that ultimately, to take it to the extreme, allow landholders to go to the Planning and Environment Court. When I looked at it myself it was only when I appreciated that there is a difference between remnant and the application of the offsets for remnant vegetation vis-a-vis regrowth vegetation that the clarity that the member is looking for was called up. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127153"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Callide--LNP) (8.32 pm): Clause 7 is again another example where the subjectivity that is the basis of the concern with this legislation is evident. Clause 7(2) says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1127155"></A>
A regional vegetation management code may provide for the protection of the habitat of native wildlife prescribed under the Nature Conservation Act as endangered, vulnerable, rare or near threatened wildlife. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127156"></A>
That can mean almost anything. That is the problem. It can mean almost anything. For landholders who have to deal with this on the ground, that particular regional vegetation management code that may provide for the protection of habitat of native wildlife prescribed as endangered can mean anything. It is open to interpretation. First of all is whether the particular vegetation is a habitat of that native wildlife so prescribed. That prescription is awfully broad. The wildlife prescribed under the Nature Conservation Act as endangered, vulnerable, rare or near threatened would include just about everything. It would include the grey kangaroo. It would include most of the species of wallabies. It provides opportunities for just about any vegetation to be protected if there was an intent or desire to do that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127158"></A>
This particular clause strikes me as being almost a catch-all. A regional vegetation management code can provide for the protection of almost any vegetation to protect almost any species of wildlife. Once again that highlights the fundamental problem with this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127159"></A>
In the hands of a sensible, reasonable person it may well not be a huge problem. In the hands of a sensible, reasonable person who is genuinely trying to strike a balance between the property rights of the landholder and the desire to maintain the habitats for native wildlife, it may not be a problem. We all agree that it is desirable to maintain habitat for native wildlife. However, the problem is in the subjectivity and the application of the particular provisions of this clause. It provides a very wide avenue indeed for a particular officer to require a landholder or to stipulate particular vegetation as essential habitat under that regional vegetation management code. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127162"></A>
I ask the minister to give an indication to the people who will be affected by this particular provision what the government’s real intent is. What is the government’s real intention in relation to regional vegetation management codes and the extent to which they may or may not be used to provide protection for habitats of wildlife prescribed under the Nature Conservation Act? To what extent will those regional management codes overlay and override the other provisions of the bill that the minister has spoken about tonight? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127165"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This clause calls up the Nature Conservation Act. Under the Nature Conservation Act the species that are listed as endangered, vulnerable, rare or near threatened native wildlife are listed. Individual officers do not have the discretion to nominate a particular species because they think it is a good idea. The Nature Conservation Act is the legislation that prescribes that. That gives an assurance and certainty to landholders along the lines of which the member has expressed concern about. That is an appropriate way to determine these matters. The fears that the member has expressed simply cannot be supported when reference to the Nature Conservation Act and its contents are actually considered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127167"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The minister completely fails to understand the issue, if that is his serious response to the point I have raised. I agree and I have acknowledged that the particular wildlife species were prescribed under the Nature Conservation Act. What is not prescribed under any act is the definition of the habitat for those particular species. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1127169"></A>
A decision about whether a particular piece of vegetation constitutes a habitat is one for the individual officer and is very subjective indeed. The decision about whether that particular piece of habitat is either essential, necessary or even required is also very subjective. Under the provisions of this clause where regional vegetation management codes may provide for the protection of the habitat of native wildlife there is an enormous opportunity for that subjectivity to be used by individual officers or by the department or by the state to negate a lot of the assurances that we have been given about this legislation and to completely change the application of this legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131888"></A>
If those regional vegetation management codes contain extensive areas of vegetation that has been prescribed or decided to be classified as habitat of native wildlife prescribed under the Nature Conservation Act, then we are going to end up with a totally different result from this legislation. I have no argument that the wildlife is prescribed under the Nature Conservation Act. That clearly was not the point that I was making. I made the point that the wildlife prescribed under that act is extensive indeed, but there are no guidelines. There is no prescription of any sort in relation to what constitutes the habitat of that wide range of wildlife and there is nothing that is not completely subjective about whether any piece of that habitat is essential, or required, or necessary, or of any value to that particular wildlife at all. That is the subjectivity that I was referring to. I think the minister needs to give some indication about how that subjectivity is going to be delivered in the field.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131890"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I will be very brief because, once again, the member is speaking absolute nonsense. There is certainty. He knows full well that when you use your computer to access your regional vegetation maps for your own property you get a couple of maps. One talks about the status of the vegetation on your property; the other one lists any essential habitat that has been mapped. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131891"></A>
There has been a lot of debate and speeches made by members opposite about the need for good science. This is good science at work. The member for Callide would know that when he looks at his map there will be a list of vegetation that has been identified on a particular property and the classification of that vegetation--as to whether it is essential or a particular habitat--and the species to which it is relevant is also contained on that map. So that scientific basis, which I have heard so often being called for, is provided in those maps.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131892"></A>
Of course, if that is disputed, landholders have rights to take that up with the department and, through the property map of assessable vegetation process, redefine the boundaries based on ground truthing of the extent and composition of that vegetation. That is the simple fact, as the member for Callide well knows, because that has been in place now for quite a number of years </Hansard-Body>

Clause 15--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131896"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (8.43 pm): Clause 15 is a rather big clause and contains a range of provisions. Too many of them are also good examples of the opportunities for subjectivity to produce a completely different outcome to that which has been spoken about by the minister in the consideration of this bill before the House. It has been my experience with vegetation management legislation that my constituents tell a very different story about the way this legislation is enacted on their properties from the assurances that the minister gives here in the House every time we debate the legislation. Every time we debate the legislation we get these assurances from the minister, but they do not survive the translation from the parliament to the paddock. Out in the paddock, you get a very different result, because landholders have to deal with the officer who arrives on their property. Landholders have to deal with that officer in a situation where they feel powerless and the officer is using all the power of the state that has always been part of that vegetation management legislation from day one. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131897"></A>
There are a number of parts in this clause that illustrate that issue. The first part of the clause changes the application of the Native Forest Practice Code. The Native Forest Practice Code has been around for a while, and a number of parts of this clause address the application of the Native Forest Practice Code. I think it is incumbent on the minister to put on the record his intent in relation to the changes to the Native Forest Practice Code that are contained in proposed subdivision 1 of this particular clause. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131899"></A>
Proposed subdivision 2 relates to clearing regulated regrowth vegetation under the regrowth vegetation code. It inserts a new section 19S, which states that the minister may make a code for clearing regulated regrowth vegetation. The explanatory notes define that vegetation with two dot points. The first dot point defines regrowth vegetation as--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1131901"></A>
... woody vegetation that is of forest quality (a minimum of 11 percent foliage projective cover), has not been re-cleared since 31 December 1989 (i.e. is at least 20 years old) and is either an endangered, of concern or least concern regional ecosystem.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1131902"></A>
The second dot point defines regrowth vegetation as--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1131903"></A>
•	native vegetation 50 metres either side of watercourses in the Burdekin, Mackay-Whitsunday and Wet Tropics priority reef catchments. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131904"></A>
I have a couple of questions in regard to those definitions. I would like the minister to make it clear to the House how that first definition was arrived at--‘a minimum of 11 per cent foliage projective cover’. Where did that figure come from? It is essentially not very much at all in relation to foliage projective cover. It relates to vegetation that, to most people, would be described as sparse and thin and it would seem to be a definition that would not deserve the description of forest quality vegetation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131905"></A>
This is a point that, over the past 10 years of debate on this issue, I have made over and over again. When the minister stands up here in the parliament and talks about this vegetation--and not just the minister but also other members in the parliament--he makes it sound as though it is tropical rainforest or that it is somehow high-value forest that is a wonderful, desirable place. But some of the vegetation, even in Central Queensland but essentially out into Western Queensland, that would have a foliage projective cover of 11 per cent could not be described as forest by even the most generous descriptor. So I ask the minister to explain that definition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1131906"></A>
The second question that I would like the minister to address is in relation to the native vegetation restrictions 50 metres either side of watercourses in those priority reef catchments. I ask the minister to give a very clear undertaking that that list of watercourses will not be extended, that we will not see that restriction applied to all watercourses, or to further watercourses, in Queensland. That, too, is the great fear in this legislation. It is reinforced by the ratcheting that we have seen over a 10-year period. We start at a particular position, but we never stay there. The legislation moves all the time and that creates problems for landholders. It creates problems for that decision making that I spoke about in my contribution to the second reading debate. I think landholders need surety. Tonight they need an assurance from the minister that both of those definitions are not going to change, that they are going to stay there and that landholders can make decisions firm in the knowledge that there is not going to be a ratcheting up of the application of these provisions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136734"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In relation to the first question about the 11 per cent forest protective cover definition, that is a definition that is compliant with Australia’s reporting requirements under what is determined to be Kyoto compliant vegetation. That is a nationally consistent definition. We simply translate that into a particular percentage of forest protective cover to give practical effect to those national Kyoto compliant standards which, if I recall correctly, were actually put in place by the former Liberal National Party federal coalition government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136736"></A>
Secondly, in relation to what the member is seeking, there is no intention by myself to implement any further changes to that definition referred to--that is, the catchments--but if we were to do so I would imagine, as we have done on occasions in the past, that it would be announced during the course of an election campaign so that people can decide whether they are for any further changes or against any further changes. What we do not know, of course--applying a consistency of argument across the chamber--is whether those opposite would put in place any changes if they were elected to government. I have made our position clear. Will those opposite make their position clear that if elected to government they will not make any changes to the vegetation management legislation, but if they did what would they be? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136737"></A>
Just as the people demand of us transparency and certainty, they also demand the same of those opposite. That is why I thought it was important to note that in the last four elections that I have engaged in as a minister on not one occasion has the Liberal National Party coalition, and now the LNP, ever articulated a vegetation management policy. The people have never been able to vote on whether those opposite were going to wind back vegetation management laws or, in fact, make them stronger. They have never put themselves forward with that level of transparency. Why? Because they wanted it both ways. They did not want to offend the greenies, but they did not want to be too honest with the people of Queensland that if elected to power they would wind back the tree clearing laws and up would start the bulldozers once again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136738"></A>
The Liberal National Party has never been honest with the people of Queensland about its intentions with respect to vegetation management laws and as of tonight is still not and never will be honest because it cannot reconcile the internal differences that exist between the Libs and the Nats on this very issue. That is why tonight we saw not one former Liberal Party member sit in this chamber during the debate. Fourteen Liberal Party members refused to say anything in relation to this fundamentally important piece of legislation when in years gone by we could actually count on the support of the Liberal Party in terms of ensuring greater protection for our vegetation across the landscape.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136739"></A>
That is why I say that tonight is the official death of the old Liberal Party. What we now have on the other side of the chamber are the good old boys of the National Party in control. Get rid of the ‘L’ and be a bit more honest with the people of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
It is instructive that when the minister is asked to explain the detail of the legislation he reverts to type. We hear the same old tired rhetoric over and over again every time we debate this legislation. That is the minister’s only response to a genuine query about what the government’s intention is. That is the minister’s response to a general query about how the government sees this legislation applying on the ground. The minister has not got a clue how the Native Forest Practice Code is to be applied on the ground. That was the first question I asked in the consideration of this clause. What response did we get? We got the same tired old rhetoric from a bitter, twisted old minister who has given us the same response for the last 10 years. Every time this legislation is debated the government’s only explanation that it is prepared to offer to Queensland landholders is the bitter, twisted rhetoric that has no basis in fact and is quite simply untrue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136741"></A>
The people of Queensland know where I stand on vegetation management. I have spoken in this place at least eight times. In my second reading contribution I stated that we would respect private property rights. We would strike the right balance. We will never support the regulate-and-prosecute approach that the government has taken since 1999 and which has produced negative outcomes. It has not produced the positive outcomes that we believe can be attained by working in conjunction with landholders rather than demonising them and adopting that regulate-and-prosecute approach. Everyone knows that that has been our approach since 1999. Despite the repeated attempts of the minister to misrepresent that approach, he has failed to do so on every single occasion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136742"></A>
The people of Queensland can be assured that we are more committed to sustainable land management practices than the current government. The current government is about politics. Its vegetation management legislation is motivated by politics and political deals. It always has been and always will be. The landholders and the ecosystems and the vegetation of rural Queensland come a very poor second to the political outcomes that this government wants to achieve. It is very instructive that tonight, just like on so many other occasions when the minister has been asked to explain the detail of the legislation, the best he can do is to revert to that same tired old rhetoric. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1136743"></A>
I believe that the landholders of Queensland have a right to know, as we consider the passage of this bill and the consideration of this particular clause tonight, just what the government’s intention is in relation to the Native Forest Practice Code and what changes the minister is proposing to the code. Why is it that there are four new sections being added? What is it that the government is trying to achieve and how does it believe that the changes that are being proposed in this bill will assist in the achievement of those outcomes? The minister quite clearly does not have a clue because he would not begin to address it. Instead he engages in his bitter and twisted rhetoric. That is the sort of response we have seen over and over again. It proves beyond doubt, if any proof were ever needed, the political motivation of the government in relation to this legislation. The government has never been able to explain the detail of the legislation in this parliament. It has never been interested in the detail of the legislation. Its interest in the legislation ended in March earlier this year when the election was over and the how-to-vote cards had been handed out with the preferences marked on them. That is what its motivation was. That is what it was about and that is why the minister cannot answer the questions. </Hansard-Body>

Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I was about to say in terms of explaining this amendment until I was so rudely interrupted, this amendment affects paragraph (2) of the new section 20AC, ‘What is the essential habitat map’, which defines ‘essential habitat’. The amendment inserts before ‘remnant vegetation’ a reference to the remnant vegetation being shown on a regional ecosystem map or remnant map. The insertion of a specific reference to the mapping is required as the Vegetation Management and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 changes the definition of ‘remnant vegetation’ to refer to how vegetation exists on the ground rather than its representation on a map. The change in definition, however, required amendments to be made where the law refers to remnant vegetation depicted on the remnant vegetation map such as for determining areas of essential habitat. </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the minister for his explanation, even though as he read it to the House it was obvious he did not understand a word of it.

For the benefit of the people who will read this debate in the future, I make the observation that, from the minister’s delivery of that explanation, he understood not a word. At least we have been provided with some explanation of the amendments that are before the House. I ask whether the minister is moving both amendments to clause 16 or just one.</Hansard-Body>

Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Amendment No. 3 affects paragraph (5) of new section 20AC. The amendment clarifies that essential regrowth habitat only occurs within areas of high-value regrowth vegetation shown on a regrowth vegetation map. This amendment mirrors the function of a map in determining areas of essential habitat defined in paragraph (2) of the section. Further, this amendment simplifies the process for landholders to determine areas of essential regrowth habitat on their property and thereby any clearing restrictions proposed by the regrowth code. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141632"></A>
In relation to amendment No. 4, new section 20AH enables the chief executive, as part of a certification process of the regional ecosystem or remnant maps, to show areas of vegetation as remnant vegetation even though that at the time of certification the vegetation does not meet the definition of ‘remnant vegetation’. This ensures that areas of vegetation which could be cleared lawfully but have a requirement to be returned to remnant status after the clearing has occurred continue to be shown as remnant vegetation on the relevant vegetation management map. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141634"></A>
Paragraph (d) identifies potential areas of vegetation in which clearing for forestry activities has occurred for which the chief executive can decide to continue to show as remnant vegetation. The insertion of the paragraph clarifies that potential areas of vegetation must have been shown on a regional ecosystem map as remnant vegetation to be eligible for the chief executive to continue to show these areas as remnant on a new version of the Vegetation Management Act. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Clause 16 defines a number of maps that landholders would require. It gives some definition and some descriptors of the range of maps which become the basis of the vegetation management legislation. I think it is worthwhile illustrating at this particular juncture a point that I made earlier in the second reading debate and a point that was reinforced by the report of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. If members look at clause 16 they will see that section 20A defines what a regional ecosystem map is. Clause 20AA defines what is the remnant map. Clause 20AB defines what is the regrowth vegetation map. Clause 20AC defines what is the essential habitat map. That is an indication of the complexity and the confusion that is now a feature of the vegetation management legislation and the regulatory system that is in place. A landholder needs to consult under section 16, clause 20A, a regional ecosystem map. They need to then look at the new clause 20AA to see what their remnant map says, then under clause 20AB what their regrowth vegetation map defines and under clause 20AC what their essential habitat map defines. We have four separate maps which presumably need to be overlaid on any property boundary. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141645"></A>
The point that I would like the minister to address is the one that was made by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee in relation to the complexity that this whole vegetation management legislation has accumulated over the 10 years in which it has been changed so many times. I would ask the minister whether he has a response to, firstly, the point that I am making about the requirement for four different overlaying maps on every landholder’s property and whether or not he considers that to be an issue or whether we are going to see a continual increase in the number of maps. I would ask whether the minister has a response to the broader point that was made by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee in relation to the complexity of the legislation and the danger that that complexity presents to landholders who may mistakenly fall foul of the legislation through no fault of their own. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141648"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Simply put, as the member has pointed out during the debate, there have been numerous iterations of vegetation management legislation. In every case the member for Callide has called for greater certainty, better maps, better science and better certainty for landholders. I have agreed with him on many occasions about the need to do that. As a result of that, we continue to refine the products that are available to landholders. As a result, we now have a heightened degree of accuracy in terms of the maps that are provided to landholders. In terms of how we meld that information together, the very simple answer is that you put them all together and you form your PMAV. That becomes the point of truth with respect to the different iterations of the mapping because they tell different stories about what is happening on your piece of land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1141652"></A>
The member opposite knows the answer to that. He knows and has spoken to me about the benefits of PMAV to actually remove that level of uncertainty to that. We have continued with my commitment that I made a number of years ago about certainty provided by PMAVs. If the member has any constituent who is uncertain or is in any way confused about the mapping products that are now offered by my department, quality as they are, then my advice to him would be to tell them to go down the path of a PMAV because that will remove that level of uncertainty now and into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146697"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The issue of PMAVs is dealt with in the next clause. I was going to seek some assurances from the minister in regard to the PMAVs during the consideration of the next clause. It is interesting that the minister should raise the issue of the accuracy of the maps. In the case of all of the mapping products referred to in the clause, for landholders the biggest issue has been the inaccuracy of those maps. Earlier in the debate a number of speakers referred to the issues that are presented by the inaccuracies of those maps and the uncertainty that is introduced into the lives of landholders because suddenly they are confronted with a map that they know is totally inaccurate. I concede that I have spoken to the minister about this previously. As I understand his response they need to go through the PMAV process, which will correct those inaccuracies whatever they may be. As I understand the process, it will do that because it involves the ground proofing of the particular situation on an individual property. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146698"></A>
However, in his summation I heard the minister talk about the costs to landholders of correcting the department’s inaccuracies. I want the minister to clarify whether his solution for correcting those inaccuracies, which is for individual landholders to go through the PMAV process and to establish a PMAV for their individual property, will be at their own cost if that process is motivated by their desire simply to correct the inaccuracies of the department’s mapping. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146699"></A>
Like the member for Burnett who spoke earlier, I have constituents who own blocks of land that are fully cultivated and are growing crops, yet the land has been mapped as regrowth vegetation. As recently as last week I had to advise a constituent that the only way to have that mapping corrected was to apply for a PMAV. I believe that all landholders should apply for a property map of assessable vegetation. I will talk about that when we consider it in more detail in the next clause. I want to give the minister an opportunity to clarify the issue of costs. I ask how he sees the department meeting the costs of people who have to engage in a process, whatever that process may be, simply because of the inaccurate mapping of the department. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146700"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I actually outlined that in my summation speech. Unfortunately, clearly the member was not listening. I said that if an inaccuracy occurs as a result of something that the department has done, correcting that will be free. However, if an amendment is sought by the landholder--for example, if they have engaged in an offset and want to have that offset recognised in a PMAV that would change an existing PMAV--that will attract a cost. However, it will be free to correct an inaccuracy. That is what I said during my summation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146701"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I appreciate that response, Minister. I wanted to clarify it because the minister would understand that the landholder that I referred to earlier wanted to have it corrected. My advice to him was apparently not entirely in keeping with the situation that the minister has outlined to me. I advised him that his only option was to apply for a PMAV to have the map ground proofed. Can the minister confirm that I could have advised him to approach the department to have the map ground proofed or corrected, and the department would have done that at its own cost, or would the department have assisted him with the cost of the PMAV if he chose--and I believed this was his only choice--to go through the PMAV process in an attempt to have the department’s mapping corrected, given that he had no other reason to have a PMAV? The particular person I am talking about has a vegetable farm. There is not a tree in sight. There is no native vegetation, but the property had been mapped as ‘of concern regrowth vegetation’. I would be very pleased if I could go back to my electorate next week and tell that particular constituent that he can contact the department and the department will correct that mapping free of charge, as I believe it should. The hopeless inaccuracy of some of this mapping should not represent a financial impost to people who have to have it corrected. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1146709"></A>
The amendment corrects an omission that would have prevented the government from locking in areas of vegetation in white areas of the vegetation management maps as category X areas. Inserting a reference to vegetation shown on the regional ecosystem map or remnant map as remnant vegetation reinstates the policy intent. The amendment enables my department to show category X areas on a property map of assessable vegetation to correct a regional ecosystem map or remnant map, as well as allowing DERM to lock in any area that is white on all the vegetation management maps that is not high-value regrowth vegetation or remnant vegetation shown on the vegetation management maps. </Hansard-Body-Continued>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I indicated earlier, clause 17 deals extensively with PMAVs and proposes a number of changes to the PMAV process or the PMAVs themselves. As the minister indicated in the consideration of an earlier clause and I agreed, the property maps of assessable vegetation have provided a degree of certainty to landholders. Tonight I think it behoves me to seek from the minister a very public assurance that PMAVs will continue to provide that level of security. That is the question that I have been asked by not just my constituents but also a range of landholders across the state when, in various forums, I have talked to them about the vegetation management legislation. One cannot blame landholders for being fearful that this too will be changed. It would be an absolute travesty of justice if it were to be changed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146713"></A>
I know from previous discussions that in the past the minister has expressed a commitment to property maps of assessable vegetation. He has expressed an understanding of the necessity for the surety that those property maps of assessable vegetation provide to landholders. Tonight I seek from the minister an assurance that there is nothing in this clause, which makes a range of changes to property maps of assessable vegetation, will lessen the degree of security that property maps of assessable vegetation provide to landholders. They have been the only thing that has remained constant since they were introduced in 2004. As I understand it, they provide a legal basis for what landholders do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146714"></A>
Given the other changes that have been made and the ratcheting that has happened with a whole range of areas in the vegetation management regime, landholders need to be constantly assured that the PMAVs will remain a tool that they can use to give themselves surety and provide them with the basis for long-term decision making. I give the minister the opportunity to explain the changes that are being made to the PMAV process through this particular clause and to assure the landholders of Queensland who are concerned about it that the PMAV process will not be changed.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (9.20 pm): Once again, clause 18 deals with PMAVs and when PMAVs may be replaced by the chief executive. Once again, the essential issue here is the security that PMAVs provide and the perception at least that they are being tampered with. I note that the minister did not take the opportunity to explain in detail the changes that were made in the previous clause to the property maps of assessable vegetation. Can the minister explain the purpose of this clause in relation to changing the provisions that apply when a chief executive officer seeks to replace or amend a PMAV? This is an essential part of this legislation. I think it is essential that the minister takes this opportunity to provide those assurances to landholders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1146754"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The changes that have been provided here provide for certain circumstances to be recognised where a PMAV may need to be changed where an offset arrangement has been entered into. For example, when an area becomes a declared area or when an area has been illegally cleared would have to be reflected in an amendment to a PMAV. So this provision allows the chief executive to recognise those particular circumstances that may from time to time exist. But, underpinning that, in my view that in no way impacts upon the overall certainty provided by the PMAV system. </Hansard-Body>

That goes to the heart of the issue that I have been trying to raise in the consideration of the previous two clauses that we have considered in detail. Could the minister explain the situations that are outlined in this particular clause where property maps of assessable vegetation may be revoked and give an assurance that the provisions that allow for the revocation of those property maps of assessable vegetation do not threaten the security that landholders have sought from these maps and which I have already outlined the importance of in the consideration of the previous two clauses?</Hansard-Body>

 As in the previous clause, certain circumstances may arise--for example, approvals for clearing may exhaust themselves--that therefore may trigger amendments. Similarly, in terms of permits for native forests, that practice may no longer be applicable or where the state no longer has an interest in commercial timber in an area. These are the kinds of circumstances that are called up in this particular section and would require quite sensibly an amendment to a PMAV to reflect the existing circumstances as a result of those changed circumstances. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (9.28 pm): Clause 30 deals with amendments made to section 30 of the vegetation management legislation which relates to power to enter places. This is one of the issues that was raised by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. It is an opportunity for the minister to explain the changes that are being made in relation to the powers that his officers have to enter properties and to respond to the concerns that were raised by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee about the extent of those powers and the necessity for those powers to be extended. It is not an issue that the minister has addressed in any of his previous contributions--in either his second reading speech or his summation of the second reading debate. I ask the minister why clause 30 is making these amendments to section 30 in relation to powers that his officers have to enter places. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151975"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It simply amends the existing section of the act to provide powers of entry that already exist under other circumstances to where a person is proposing to conduct a native forest practice, or where a person is proposing to clear regulated regrowth vegetation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151977"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 With respect, Minister, that does not explain why the changes were necessary. Nor does it respond to the concerns that were raised by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. Does the minister not have a response to the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee? Is he dismissing the concerns that it raised? Does he not believe that he has some sort of obligation to respond to the parliamentary committee? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151983"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (9.30 pm): Clause 31 seeks to amend section 49 of the legislation in relation to the power to acquire a name and address. I presume from the answer the minister gave to the previous question that this, too, extends an existing power to a new circumstance. However, I would seek from him confirmation that that is the case--that the power to require that information to be provided is not an extension of the already extraordinary powers that the vegetation management legislation gives to officers and that was once again the subject of concern expressed by the committee. Can the minister explain the reason for clause 31 to amend section 49 of the Vegetation Management Act in relation to the power that officers have to require that information from landholders?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151985"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>

Clause 32--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151988"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (9.32 pm): Clause 32 relates once again to some of those subjective decisions that I have expressed concern about and I think were reflected in the report of the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee. Clause 32 allows the insertion of new sections 54A and 54C. 54A provides for the issuance of stop-work notices, requiring a person to stop committing an offence or to not commit that type of offence again. It is dependent upon a person or an official reasonably believing that a person is committing an offence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151990"></A>
It is quite an extraordinary situation, when you think about it, that an official only has to reasonably believe that a person is committing an offence to be able to issue a stop-work notice. It is that essential reversal of the onus of proof that has been found to be so offensive by landholders and that I have spoken about at great length every time this legislation is considered in the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151991"></A>
I take it from the response the minister has given to the previous two clauses that this section of clause 32, which inserts a new section 54A, extends that power, as obnoxious as it might be, to a new circumstance rather than changing or extending the exercise of that power. I seek the minister’s confirmation of that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151992"></A>
The insertion of proposed new section 54B provides for restoration notices. This section applies if an official reasonably believes that a person has committed a vegetation clearing offence whether before or after the commencement of this section and the matter is capable of being rectified. The official may give the person a restoration notice requiring the person to rectify the matter. This, too, is an extraordinary situation. It allows an official who only has to reasonably believe that an offence has been committed to give the person a restoration notice. A restoration notice can, at the complete discretion of the official, require certain works to be carried out. Whether or not those works are reasonable is not something that a landholder, that I can see, can appeal against or seek a second opinion about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151994"></A>
I seek the minister’s explanation of why proposed new section 54B is required in relation to a restoration notice. How does the minister justify those extraordinary circumstances that those two new sections provide? The stop-work notice is in itself bad enough, but I would suggest that the new section 54B in relation to the restoration notice gives extraordinary powers to officials, who only have to reasonably believe that an offence has been committed, to order that work and order landholders to take the steps that are listed there in the body of the clause. Given the concerns that have been expressed not just by me but also by the Scrutiny of Legislation Committee, before the House accepts the granting of those extraordinary powers an explanation should be provided as to why they are part of the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151996"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 What it does is improve the clarity of the rights of the landholder by splitting the stop-work notice from the restoration notice. As a result of that, the landholder has the ability to trigger an internal review process of the decision to stop work by a vegetation management officer. Once that has been clarified, a restoration notice can be applied. So the rights of the landholder are recognised and the landholder has the ability to request a review of the original stop-work notice. Once it is clarified that the stop-work notice was justified--that obviously results in a higher standard of proof that illegal clearing has occurred--then that can trigger the restoration notice. That brings, in my view, greater clarity than perhaps existed previously. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1151998"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I do accept at least part of the explanation that the minister has given. It illustrates the very essential need for landholders, or any Queenslander that is subject to an administrative decision, to at least have that decision reviewed by somebody else. In relation to the explanation that the minister has given about the stop-work notice, I agree that is an improvement in the protection of that particular person’s right to at least have that decision reviewed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1152000"></A>
In relation to the second part, the new section 54B that will be created by clause 32, the restoration notice and the powers conferred under that restoration notice are quite extraordinary indeed. I ask the minister whether or not the same opportunity for review is also included in the legislation. Does the landholder who is presented with one of these restoration notices and who may well believe that the requirements of the restoration notice are unreasonable, are unworkable, or simply will not provide the outcome that is being suggested, have a right of appeal or a method of having that decision reviewed? Would that not be considered to be a very basic right of anybody subject to this sort of administrative decision? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157686"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The answer to this question is in your last sentence. Given that it is an administrative decision, the landholder has the right under other provisions to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. What we have tried to do in recognition once again of previous debates about complaints about heavy-handed legislation is provide a stepped approach and alternative approaches rather than just going down the path of going through a Magistrate’s Court. Rather than this being seen to be, as has been suggested, another way to use the stick against a landholder this is actually, in our view, a more flexible way. Landholders can choose to have their matters heard in less formal settings than would otherwise be the case in a Magistrate’s Court. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157690"></A>
Out of that it is hoped that there will be a greater level of satisfaction that complaints have been heard in a staged process. Ultimately, the landholder can still go through the Magistrate’s Court process as a result of prosecution but there is another option for having matters heard which is less aggressive than going down that path. </Hansard-Body>

Clause 35--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157695"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (9.41 pm): Clause 35 involves the insertion of a new part 3 division 1 subdivision 8 relating to restoration plans. It is quite an extensive clause and outlines the requirements of those restoration plans. The subdivision applies if--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1157697"></A>
(a) 	an official gives a person a restoration notice in relation to the committing of a vegetation clearing offence on land; and </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1157698"></A>
(b) 	the notice requires the person to prepare a plan (a <Hansard-Italic>
restoration plan</Hansard-Italic>
) to rectify the matter by restoring vegetation on the land. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157700"></A>
There are a number of subsections: 55AB relates to preparing the restoration plan; 55AC relates to approving the restoration plan; 55AD is where the chief executive may amend an approved restoration plan; 55AE relates to steps after and the taking effect of the decision; and 55AF deals with failing to comply with a restoration notice. It is quite an extensive addition to the vegetation management legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157701"></A>
Can I ask the minister why this particular provision relating to restoration plans needed to be inserted in the legislation at all? Why is it as extensive as it is? Once again, it is quite an extraordinary situation when one reads through the details of those subsections. It gives quite extraordinary powers to the department and there one can read the official who is dealing with the particular case. It gives quite extraordinary powers to those people to require actions in relation to this restoration process and quite extraordinary powers to change those requirements under the restoration plan in a whole range of circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157702"></A>
It is again a continuation of the process which has over a period of time taken the control of an individual’s land away from them as individuals and increasingly given that control to the state. Here it is identified as the chief executive. In most cases it is exercised by individual officers. I wonder whether there are particular instances in the operation of the Vegetation Management Act that have instigated the inclusion of this clause in the bill? Has its inclusion been precipitated by any particular circumstance? Is there an explanation for the continued expansion of those extraordinary powers that have been a feature of this legislation from its first introduction into this House? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157703"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 What this provision simply provides for is an indication of just how serious we are when it comes to remediation orders against people who have broken the law. This is at the heart of this. This is something the member continues to fail to recognise. The people that we are talking about are those minority of landholders who break the law. They may not like the law, but they have still broken it. If we are to be serious about taking action against those people, including orders for remediation, then we need extensive provisions such as this to ensure that remediation is carried, that that remediated land and vegetation is protected for the long term and that it does not become a joke and in times ahead it will just be cleared again. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1157706"></A>
It is a very strong message to landholders that if they break the law then there will be a range of responses according to the nature of the illegal clearing. The simple message is: do not illegally clear and you will not have to worry about these provisions. </Hansard-Body>

Dr FLEGG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Moggill--LNP) (9.49 pm): The residents of the far-western suburbs of Brisbane have battled for years now to get something done about both road congestion and road safety, particularly along the state government controlled Moggill Road. I was pleased to see recently that the Kenmore bypass study group has finally come up with a design for a Kenmore bypass that they say is environmentally and engineering feasible and that this preferred design, which now has been put out to the community, will be submitted to the state government to see if it can be acceptable to it. This is the first time in many decades any potential plan has been put on the table to deal with the worst traffic and transport black spots that we have in the City of Brisbane. There has been nothing on the table that would deal with it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163339"></A>
Because of the lack of road transportation options for commuters, my electorate has an equally ineffective system of public transport, with no bus priority and no busways. All that the bus commuters in the Moggill electorate get is a doubling of their fares. They do not get any extra services. Their services are overcrowded, they do not have a bus lane and they do not have bus priority. It is a second-rate service. So although it is a long way from having a design put forward by the bypass study group, it is at least a step in the right direction. There is a plan being put to the government for consideration and we will wait very eagerly to see the government’s reaction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163340"></A>
After consulting the main roads minister, I was very pleased to be informed the other day that he has asked Main Roads to go back and reconsider a pedestrian crossing and lights at the intersection of Grandview Road and Moggill Road. I have ranked this intersection as the most dangerous traffic location in my very large Brisbane electorate. The government has previously accepted that it is a dangerous location but that it would be too costly to fix. The cost of not fixing the safety issue at the corner of Grandview Road and Moggill Road is what we cannot afford. This is the most likely place that I know of in the western suburbs to have a preventable fatality and, for the sake of the cost of a set of traffic lights, we should not be dismissing it. I welcome that reconsideration. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs SCOTT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Woodridge--ALP) (9.52 pm): The opening of a new police station is always a welcome event in any community, and to Crestmead and the nearby suburb of Marsden for quite a number of years community members have looked forward to an expanded police presence. It was through Community Renewal that a police beat was established a number of years ago and locals soon learned that Sergeant Col Henderson was quick to respond to their issues and knew the local area well. Col and his assistant officer were regulars at the Neighbourhood Watch meetings and, along with the police based at Browns Plains Police Station, crime in the area has been kept to a minimum. However, this is a high-growth area, with the largest percentage of children aged under 15 anywhere in the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163348"></A>
Planning began and a suitable site on Browns Plains Road was chosen, right on the boundary of the electorate of Woodridge and Mr Speaker’s electorate of Logan. The result has been a state-of-the-art facility at a cost of $5 million, which will be manned by 27 general duty police officers, of whom 12 will be taking up new positions, plus 14 Tactical Crime Squad officers and four plain-clothes investigators. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163350"></A>
It was a real privilege to have our police minister, Neil Roberts, once again visiting the electorate to open another first-class facility. Also present was Deputy Commissioner Kathy Rynders, who has previously worked in Logan; our Assistant Commissioner for the South Eastern region, Paul Wilson; Superintendent Alistair Dawson; many other senior officers; plus many members of the Queensland Police Service, including volunteers in policing; representatives from the Logan council; Neighbourhood Watch members; and many others from the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163356"></A>
We were all welcomed by Senior Sergeant Rob Mulhern, who is one very proud officer-in-charge, and given a tour of this fine facility. During the opening ceremony, emceed by Superintendent Alistair Dawson, our regional police chaplain Graeme Ramsden blessed the facility and prayed for the safety of those who work in this area covering Crestmead, Marsden, Heritage Park, Park Ridge, Waterford West and Logan Reserve. The Hon. John Mickel, who also attended, and I will both see the benefits of a greater police presence in our electorates. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163358"></A>
Through Community Renewal funding, a special youth facility has also been built at the Crestmead Community Centre, which is now a dedicated PCYC run by Sergeant Mel Cowie, who is a fantastic youth worker and who has spent many years in the Beenleigh-Logan area. It is very gratifying to see the responsiveness of our senior police and our government in planning for these high-growth areas. Our Police Service is the lead agency in our communities and I have confidence that, with the stronger focus on outcomes for our school students, early intervention programs and the partnership between police, our PCYC and Neighbourhood Watch, we will see growth take place with a strong sense of community and crime kept to a minimum.</Hansard-Body>

Mr POWELL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Glass House--LNP) (9.55 pm): When is the Bligh Labor government going to stop playing politics with our teachers and students? Let me give members just three brief examples--examples of a pilfering and penny-pinching bureaucracy. On several occasions I have raised the concerns of parents that, after a long-fought battle by the Australian Primary Principals Association and the Queensland Teachers Union, state schools were seeing very little of the extra $100 per student agreed upon by the federal government. These schools have been promised only $10,000 from the Bligh Labor government, regardless of whether they have 30 or 300 students. As one parent has told me--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1163368"></A>
This battle was paid for by financial members contributing their own funds to lobby governments and ensure that funding is equitable and appropriate. While this--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Continued>
<A ID="pgfId-1163369"></A>
the $10,000--</Hansard-Body-Continued>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1163371"></A>
is a small percentage of the full funds awarded by the Federal Government, it is still better than nothing at all. Unfortunately, despite promises that the schools would receive this $10,000 funding as part of their term 4 payment, the funding has still not materialised. It is Politics, pilfering and penny pinching.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163372"></A>
My second example relates to teacher relief funding. Schoolteachers receive 10 days of sick leave a year as well as allocations for carer’s leave, maternity leave and so on. Reports have shown that teachers use up the majority of these days each year. Unfortunately, schools receive only between 3 and 4 days of teacher relief funding per teacher. A prep student will tell you that 3 does not equal 10. So what recourse do principals have? Do they cancel leave? No. It is an entitlement. Do they withhold teacher relief? No. Who looks after the kids? Put simply, principals arrange for relief and then hope and pray they do not go over their allocation because, if they do, it means cuts in other areas--areas such as student resources, excursions, sporting events or much needed school maintenance. It is penny pinching.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1163374"></A>
My final example is to do with the rollout of BER funding. But let me use the words of Mr Kelvin Mickelson, a member of the P&amp;C at Glass House Mountains State School. In response to a reply from the minister for education he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As for a solution, I add my voice to the federal government report, which was reported in the <Hansard-Italic>

Mr MOORHEAD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Waterford--ALP) (9.58 pm): Sunday, 27 October saw the return of the St Joseph’s of Tobruk memorial school fete, an event returning to Beenleigh after a number of years. St Joseph’s, and principal David Boulton, provide a high-quality education, but also ensure students have an understanding of the important social issues facing our community such as the plight of our Indigenous Australians and the need to care for our environment. I know that St Joseph’s also holds a special place in the heart of the member for Albert, Margaret Keech.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1169123"></A>
This high standard was seen in the Parents and Friends Association and the work they put into a successful fete. Despite the hot weather, the fete was well attended by our local community. A special mention must go to the prep class which had a plant stall, including tomato plants they had propagated in their garden. The takings at the bar were well supported by the television screen giving supporters the opportunity to have a burger, a beer and watch the V8 Supercars go round at the Nikon SuperGP. However, the highlight of the fete was the Cupcake Challenge, an opportunity for the St Joseph’s community to show their cupcake culinary skills. With categories for students, staff, families and community members and winners for best design, best cupcake and the most unusual, the competition was hard fought, with entries having to close early due to the volume of entries.The winners were judged by recently crowned Beenleigh Show Best Cupcake winner Emily-Jade from <Hansard-Italic>

Communities all over Queensland have celebrated Queensland’s 150th birthday. In Logan and Beenleigh, we have seen the installation of an historical display at Old Beenleigh Town, the commissioning of a book on our local pioneers and the naming of the Davy Gooding Bridge over Boundary Street, Beenleigh. On Sunday I attended the Q150 show for the Cavy Owners and Breeders Society of Queensland at the Beenleigh Showgrounds. It was only about three months ago that I discovered that the Cavy Club compete on who can breed the best guinea pig. Along with the normal competition, there was a special Queensland icons competition where breeders displayed cavies dressed up as Queensland icons. In the junior section, the Great Barrier Reef display, a cavy displayed as a turtle pipped the Storey Bridge display which included a cavy and flashing lights. Although the senior section was won by the cavy displayed on an iconic Gold Coast beach, the most creative display had to go to the Joh and Flo display with cavies displayed on a bed of peanuts surrounded by ETU and SEQEB placards. Congratulations to Hanna Dominic and Kathryn Mackay on a great show and a fun day to celebrate the occasion. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(10.01 pm): I rise to talk about a wonderful thing that occurred recently in Casey’s Road in the Coomera electorate. Residents of the Casey’s Road community have been fighting for the restoration of their bus service which was terminated abruptly and without prior notice by TransLink last year. A dedicated push by the residents and months of persistence with TransLink has finally paid off. I was pleased to be part of the push to restore the service. Amazingly, however, there was a report in the paper from the member from Broadwater talking about how wonderful it was that the Casey’s Road service had been restored, yet the member for Broadwater did not want to know the people in Casey’s Road when Casey’s Road was in the Broadwater electorate. </Hansard-Body>

The bus stop is just a short walk from the entrance to the Sanctuary Cove residential precinct and much closer than the Sanctuary Cove Village bus stop to both the people who reside in Casey’s Road and the people of Sanctuary Cove. Five daily services began on 5 October and will continue for a trial period until April 2010. Following discussions with TransLink, I expect that within a 12-month time frame a full review of bus services throughout the northern Gold Coast area will occur with a view to better serving the residents in this fast growing corridor.</Hansard-Body>

In the northern end of the electorate we have an ecofriendly builder. Mitchell Enviro Industrial Estate has won the 2009 Queensland Professional Excellence Award in the environmentally sustainable development category. Developer Bruce Mitchell decided to create something special six years ago. I regard him as the Michelangelo of the sustainable building industry and someone who can lead others and set environmental standards. Bruce has developed Australia’s first totally self-sustaining and carbon-neutral industrial estate. The estate took shape from a block of land six years ago and Bruce knew exactly what it would look like today. His goal was to eventually house 52 booths within an eco display centre with information about products that will make a positive impact on the environment. Features of the estate include a solar power system so the estate can operate free of the electricity grid. Recycled materials have been used wherever possible in all construction on the estate. I commend Bruce Mitchell for his efforts. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Barron River--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.04 pm): In 2008, 28 people were killed on roads in Far North Queensland. Each year we hope and expect that fewer people will die in road crashes on Queensland roads than the year before. In 2009, however, 40 people have already died in road accidents in Far North Queensland, already 12 more than the total for last year. I am sure that all members would join with me in expressing our condolences to the families and friends of those who have lost their lives. If people continue to die at this rate, which is currently one a week, we will nearly double last year’s toll. These statistics, whilst horrifying, can never convey the terrible grief, loss and suffering that is left in the wake of fatal road crashes. Whilst we rightly focus on road fatalities, scores more people are seriously injured, in some cases suffering permanent and catastrophic injuries. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1169136"></A>
Following the news of yet another fatal road crash some time ago, I decided that it was time that we ought to conduct a further examination of our region’s spiralling road toll in the form of a regional road safety summit. I did this because I firmly believe that as a community we can never give up the fight against road crash fatalities and trauma. We can never accept the inevitability of this human tragedy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1169137"></A>
I am very grateful for the support shown for the concept of a regional road safety summit. The ministers for police and emergency services, the Minister for Main Roads and the Minister for Transport have all agreed to attend. The Premier’s office also supports the idea. The concept of a regional road safety summit has been widely debated in the community in Far North Queensland and has been generally endorsed. I think that this reflects the widespread and deep community concern about the issue of road safety. Road safety experts from the Police Service, the Fire and Rescue Service and the Ambulance Service will attend the road safety summit and analyse the fatal road crashes in the region with a view to identifying strategies to be employed in the future to improve our road safety and road safety messages. I particularly want members of the public to have an opportunity to contribute their ideas to the summit. Some 500 members of the community have participated in an online forum to contribute their ideas and 200 have registered to attend the summit which will take place on 17 November at the Hilton Hotel in Cairns. This is an important strategy in continuing the fight against road fatalities and serious injuries in our region. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (10.07 pm): This morning, like most weekday mornings and increasingly at the weekend as well, traffic was gridlocked along Oxley Road and Honour Avenue in my electorate as vehicles tried to negotiate the trip across the Walter Taylor Bridge. This is a regular nightmare for residents of Chelmer, Graceville, Sherwood, Corinda and Tennyson. It is a situation that risks getting worse with the Labor state government intent on increasing the density of housing in my electorate. While Labor wants to pack more people into my electorate, it does not feel any responsibility for the consequences of traffic congestion from those additional residents. It admits it has no solution. I do not think that is good enough. I think the state government should be looking at a range of initiatives to ease this congestion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1169141"></A>
Let me suggest one initiative that I believe could make a difference to daily gridlock and the congestion on the Walter Taylor Bridge. It is well known that congestion on the bridge is considerably reduced on non-school days. On school days a notorious bottleneck north of the bridge is worsened with cars trying to turn right on the Westminster Road to drop off students at Indooroopilly High, St Peters, Brigidine and Holy Family schools. I believe that the state government should provide a high frequency bus service running from the Lambert Road entry of the Indooroopilly Railway Station just for the students attending these schools and running the hours before and after school. </Hansard-Body>

Mr EMERSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 In addition, dedicated security guards should be allocated to train carriages travelling between the Corinda and Indooroopilly stations during those periods before and after school.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1174902"></A>
The provision of the bus service, along with security guards, will hopefully encourage some parents who currently ferry their children across the bridge to school to instead choose to use a train or a bus. They will know that their children get to and from school safely and on time so they do not have use the car. Every car we get off the road before it gets to the Walter Taylor Bridge helps ease traffic congestion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1174906"></A>
The initiative of this new bus service is just one idea. I am sure there are others. I would encourage members of the community to work with me to find solutions to this traffic congestion. Unfortunately, the Labor state government is not committed to looking for solutions to traffic congestion in my electorate. It seems only intent on creating additional challenges. I take the interjection from the member for Everton, who asks how we would pay for this. There is a simple solution to that: use the $1.9 million that the Labor Party is using for its advertising campaign on the asset sales. It would well and truly pay for this and other initiatives in my electorate and many other electorates, including those of Labor members. <Hansard-Speech-End>

They were all in the Jacaranda Parade, which went very successfully. I also want to thank past committee members and present committee members for the Jacaranda Festival. </Hansard-Body>

We also had the Springfield Lakes Open Day. I would like to thank the Springfield Lakes Neighbourhood Watch, particularly Steve Embelton, who helped erect the new Jo-Ann Miller marquee. We have two of them which are available for community use. There was the Rotary Club of Goodna, the Lions Club, the Springfield Lakes Leisure Group, the day care centres and all of our schools, particularly the Springfield Lakes State School--and its choir sang a number of songs at the open day. Springfield Christian Family was also there. It was a very hot day and I would like to thank St John Ambulance, who provided water to everyone on the day. It was very hot--about 34 degrees--and I hope they will revert to holding this particular event in winter. </Hansard-Body>

The Springfield Lakes State School is a tremendous state school in my electorate. I know it is very grateful for the Commonwealth funding for its new community hall. The school community wants the prime purpose of the hall to be for teaching and learning of all students at the school. Tonight the P&amp;C reaffirmed this position. I support the school community in its implacable opposition to this hall being hijacked by other levels of government or other departments for the delivery of their core services other than for educational purposes. Education is the core business of this school and we want the best education for our children in the Springfield Lakes region. This new school hall, its design and function should be based on the school ethos, the school culture and its community partnerships. I totally support the school’s objectives in its design and implementation principles. </Hansard-Body>

I would like to thank the P&amp;C for keeping me informed on their progress, and I look forward to opening the new hall in the future. I would like to say to the P&amp;C: stick to your guns and this school hall will be of great benefit to the Springfield Lakes community. <Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Maryborough--Ind) (10.13 pm): Maryborough is a very generous city that believes in looking after its own, especially when they are having a tough time. My good mate Bob Carlson, who is one of the best piano players I have ever worked with in my former life as a professional musician, has unfortunately come down with motor neurone disease. He is really suffering from this debilitating and wasting disease to the point that he cannot play the piano anymore. A lot of the musicians who have come out of our area re-formed bands and people travelled from all over the place to put on a benefit concert for Bob Carlson in our wonderful Brolga Theatre last Thursday night. The aim of this was to raise funds for ongoing medical treatment for Bob. </Hansard-Body>

Everybody turned out: the Ken Hodgkinson big band; Star, an international dancer; the MoJo jazz band; Ross Williams, an international blues artist whose music I particularly enjoyed; Kajafa, the rock band; Keri McInerney, who was one of the major organisers of this particular benefit concert; Bobkats, the country band from Hervey Bay; Mark Nuske, another mate of mine who is simply one of the best guitarists I have ever heard play; the very famous Blue Heeler Band, who have travelled all over Australia; and Troy Cassar-Daley, another very close friend of mine. He travelled all the way up from Brisbane. He is a very busy boy these days, between travelling to Nashville to record and so forth. Because he had played in the band with Bob, he came up. The Blue Heeler Band re-formed and did some rather memorable numbers. It was a fabulous concert and a fabulous night. </Hansard-Body>

There were auctions of various items donated by people in the community. Anyone who knows me knows that I ride a Harley and I love Harley memorabilia. I had a very nice pair of Harley boots which I had the privilege of auctioning off. They were bought by none other than the wife of the member for Hervey Bay, Ted Sorensen. I was speaking to Ted at half-time. I said, ‘Mate, those boots fetched a good price.’ He said, ‘Yeah, I bought them.’ So that was a good thing. What a wonderful night. Jan Carlson, Bob’s ever-patient wife, has supported him throughout his illness from motor neurone disease. Jan, Keri and many other people worked tirelessly to put this particular concert together. It was so successful that we are looking at doing it on an annual basis to benefit any number of charities. Again, I say that Maryborough looks after its own. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (10.16 pm): On Thursday, 15 October I was very pleased to join the federal Treasurer, Wayne Swan; the federal Minister for Housing, Tanya Plibersek; the federal member for Brisbane, Arch Bevis; the Brisbane Housing Co. Chair, John McAuliffe; and the CEO, David Cant, to celebrate the BHC’s landmark project at Newstead in Brisbane--just down the road from where I live. When completed, the 95 apartments at Newstead will include 30 National Rental Affordability Scheme homes, 26 social housing dwellings funded by the Nation Building--Economic Stimulus Plan and 39 privately owned units. In fact, it will be the first of its type ever built in Queensland and, my understanding is, almost in Australia where there is a combination of social housing and private dwelling all in the one project. It truly is a great example of how this type of economic stimulus is supporting jobs not only in the construction industry but also during a global economic recession. At least 350 jobs are being created with the support of this program. </Hansard-Body>

It was great to represent Minister Struthers there. I congratulate the Brisbane Housing Co. on its vision in getting this terrific project off the ground. This project shows the great results that can be achieved when all three levels of government work together with local industry to provide affordable housing. I also thank Michael McNab, the builder of this great project.</Hansard-Body>

I will give a little bit of history. The Brisbane Housing Co. was set up in 2002 as a joint initiative between the state government and the Brisbane City Council with its first chairman of the board, Kevin Seymour. It is now an independent company providing much needed affordable housing throughout Brisbane. In my electorate alone there are 10 BHC developments and managed complexes, with two more currently under construction and another two in the planning stage. It was set up with great vision by the state government with an initial equity injection of $60 million. The majority of that money came from the state government together with the Brisbane City Council. It had planned for 400 dwellings aimed at rents at 25 per cent below the market rate for those who cannot afford full market prices. </Hansard-Body>

Seven years later, under the chairmanship of John McAuliffe, we now see that a company that started employing four people now employs 20. It has delivered in excess of 700 homes and by 2012 expects to have 1,200 homes in occupation. This model is a great model. It is based on the charity concept. It is delivering real homes in the social and affordable housing sector for people much in need not only in my electorate but also around Brisbane and Queensland. It is a credit to those with the vision to set it up. I commend the board and the staff of BHC. <Hansard-Speech-End>
