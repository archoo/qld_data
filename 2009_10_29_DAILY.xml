Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have received a letter from the member for Maroochydore seeking an amendment to standing orders as to how petitions are tabled in parliament. The member correctly points out that often members will present paper petitions for tabling or sponsor e-petitions, even though they do not personally agree with their contents, on the basis that it is the right of citizens to expect their elected representatives to present or sponsor petitions on their behalf. The member is concerned that, unfortunately, the media and members of the public do not always understand that a member, in presenting or sponsoring a petition, is fulfilling a representative role and does not necessarily support or endorse the substance of the petition.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999264"></A>
The member suggests that an additional method for ensuring petitions are tabled in parliament be devised, whereby the public can lodge petitions for tabling directly with the Clerk. I have directed that this correspondence be copied to each member of the Standing Orders Committee for consideration. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999267"></A>
In the interim, however, I believe that it is appropriate for me to state that I have considerable sympathy for the member’s concerns about the misunderstanding by the media and members of the public about the member’s role in the petitioning process. I wish to place on record that a member is elected to represent their entire electorate. Sometimes this entails making representations or actioning matters which the member may not personally or ideologically be in agreement with. One role of a member is to present paper petitions or sponsor e-petitions from their constituents--even if they do not agree with their contents. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I wish to advise the House of three significant events that will soon be held here at Parliament House. On Monday, 23 November, I will launch the Speaker’s Christmas Tree Appeal. I urge all members, parliamentary and electorate staff, and members of the public to support this appeal. Donations to the appeal will be directed to two very worthy charities--Project: Love and Care, and ACT for Kids, formerly the Abused Child Trust. I want to thank Channel 7 for partnering with the Speaker’s Christmas Tree Appeal and for the upcoming publicity support it will provide, together with any other media outlets that wish to join in promoting the appeal.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999285"></A>
The second major upcoming event will be held on the morning of Thursday, 26 November. At 8 am on this day, prior to our final sitting day for the year, I will host a multi-faith service in the Legislative Council chamber. Eight of Queensland’s religious leaders will jointly deliver this service of prayer that is themed ‘Caring for our community’. I extend an invitation to all honourable members to attend. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999290"></A>
Finally, on Wednesday, 16 December, the Queensland parliament will host its first citizenship ceremony. I have received the honour of being granted Presiding Officer status for this event, and along with the Governor, Her Excellency Ms Penelope Wensley, I will welcome 100 new Australians as they become citizens. I encourage all honourable members to attend this historic ceremony. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.37 am): The liquefied natural gas industry has the potential to rival coal and tourism in terms of importance to the Queensland economy. Eight companies have expressed their intention to construct LNG production and export facilities here, with seven of them intending to locate in a dedicated industry hub in Gladstone. Should even a mid-size, 28 million tonnes per annum LNG industry eventuate, it would result in massive economic benefits for Queensland--over 18,000 jobs and an increase in gross state product of around $3 billion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999323"></A>
That is why my government has worked tirelessly to ensure the industry has every possible support and backing. We have extended the Gladstone State Development Area to the southern part of Curtis Island to accommodate large LNG plants. While more than 70 per cent of the State Development Area will be locked away to protect the environment, we will still have room for an industry precinct occupying more than 1,500 hectares. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999326"></A>
We have created an infrastructure corridor between Callide and Gladstone where gas pipelines servicing LNG plants can be located. Last month, we released our blueprint for Queensland’s LNG industry to help guide development in coming years. That blueprint gives certainty to intending industry in relation to matters such as their environmental requirements and their royalty obligations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999329"></A>
I am pleased to inform the House today that our support of the industry is starting to pay off in real and concrete ways. Tonight, the Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy will open the new headquarters for one of those companies that is vying for these plants, Santos, a major LNG proponent. Santos’s new Queensland headquarters in Turbot Street has facilities for more than 550 staff and it will also be home to the new Australian headquarters for Malaysia’s Petronas, Santos’s partner in the Gladstone liquefied natural gas project. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001843"></A>
We will see Santos and its partner Petronas located in a new office here in Brisbane. This is happening today--even while the project is still going through the full approval process. More importantly than the opening of a new building--much more importantly--is the commitment of this gas project to jobs. Today Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas is announcing a $50 million program to employ more apprentices and trainees, more Indigenous workers, and increase education and training in LNG related skills. As part of the plan to be rolled out over five years, it will spend $16 million for up to 100 new diesel mechanics and electrical apprentices and traineeships in plant operations. It will spend $4 million on a special training package to support an ambitious target of 300 Indigenous jobs. It is committing $30 million to curriculum and training packages in Queensland schools, TAFEs and universities to further develop LNG and coal seam gas skills here in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001848"></A>
Up to 6,000 workers will be required for this one project, and around 1,000 permanent operational staff will be required in regional Queensland. Many of the skills needed to deliver this project simply do not exist in great numbers yet in the Australian workforce, and this is an important opportunity for a massive program of upskilling.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001849"></A>
I welcome the announcement from Santos today. I look forward to similar announcements from some of the other major proponents. I see this as a vote of confidence in Queensland, the long-term resilience and prosperity of the Queensland economy and particularly to regional Queensland in Gladstone and in the south-west that will be the major beneficiaries from this major new industry and investment. </Hansard-Body>

Climate Change</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001852"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.41 am): My government has a strong and proven commitment to meeting the challenges of climate change head-on. To reflect this, today I would like to outline for the House two significant and important events taking place next week to address this important issue. To begin with, next week I will be attending the Council for the Australian Federation meeting in Adelaide. This is a critical opportunity for first ministers of all of the states and territories of Australia to come together to discuss issues of national importance. The major focus of this Council for the Australian Federation meeting will be climate change.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001855"></A>
Queensland is not only the state most vulnerable to climate change impact but also the region with the most to gain from effective national and international action and cooperation. State and territory governments have an important role to play in addressing the challenges presented by climate change and differentiating their obligations from the Commonwealth. The meeting will start off with a business round table so state governments can hear firsthand from business about how we can best work with them to transition Australia to a low-carbon economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001857"></A>
The round table will identify opportunities for states and territories to work together with business on collaborative projects to deliver tangible benefits for the community. This will include looking at ways in which to provide support for electric vehicles, infrastructure for renewable and low-carbon energy, more efficient and effective land use planning, new innovations in buildings and promotion of lasting energy efficiency savings. States and territories will be working together in key areas including supporting innovation in the development of low-carbon technologies and building a workforce that is capable of meeting the needs of new and emerging green industries.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001858"></A>
One of the significant things about this meeting is that it recognises that regional governments, both here in Australia and around the world, have a distinct and important role to play in assisting in adapting and mitigating the effects of climate change. It is regional and state governments that have responsibility legislatively and constitutionally for matters such as land use planning, electricity supply, building codes and other similar issues. This is critical in the lead-up to the Copenhagen talks. The Premier of South Australia will be chairing the regional government section of the Copenhagen talks.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001860"></A>
Also next week my government is hosting the Queensland Climate Change Summit here at Parliament House. This summit will be held next Wednesday in partnership with the world’s leading international climate change non-profit organisation, the Climate Group. This is one of a number of international events the Climate Group is supporting in the lead-up to a critical climate change meeting in Copenhagen in December. We are staging next week’s summit to have a timely dialogue with businesses here in Queensland on the challenges ahead. We want a business-to-business exchange of strategies for dealing with the emerging low-carbon economy, its challenges and, importantly here in Queensland, its opportunities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001863"></A>
The participants in this summit represent big industry in Queensland, including the coal and energy sectors, developers and retailers. We are urging them to promote low-carbon leadership within the broader business community as we move to Copenhagen and beyond. The eyes of the world will be focused on Copenhagen in December when the 192 members of the United Nations and hundreds of delegates attend the United Nations climate leaders summit. Together with the Victorian and South Australian premiers, my government’s climate change and sustainability minister, Kate Jones, will be joining the official and vital Australian delegation to Copenhagen. We face a unique dual challenge--the challenge of promoting economic growth while at the same time ensuring that Australia can play its part in addressing the prospect of dangerous climate change impacts. That will be the focus of my minister, Kate Jones, at this summit as Queensland looks forward to working with other states and territories and the nations of the world in meeting one of the biggest challenges of our times. </Hansard-Body>

Barcaldine and Longreach, Community Cabinet</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001867"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.45 am): Community cabinet this weekend will take place in Barcaldine and Longreach on Sunday and Monday. Once again, my government will be taking government to the people of Queensland wherever they live. This will be my 19th community cabinet as Premier, and I can honestly say that I have enjoyed every one of them and that I am looking forward to Barcaldine and Longreach this weekend. Community cabinet is about ensuring that we as a government are staying in touch with the people of this state. That concept is especially relevant in these vibrant communities which are thousands of kilometres to the west of Brisbane. It is a great opportunity for all to come along and meet the state’s key decision makers, ministers and directors-general.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001868"></A>
So far there have been 55 scheduled formal deputations for Barcaldine on Sunday and another 28 for Monday in Longreach. That is a 66 per cent increase on the most recent previous community cabinets in the area. In 2002, the total number of deputations was 50 and in 1998 it was 48. That turnout shows that Queenslanders continue to take up the opportunity to meet with their government on their turf and on their terms. I thank the local member for his assistance to his constituents. His electorate office has been very helpful in passing on the details for those seeking deputations. Everyone is welcome to attend this forum and I look forward to spending some time with the people of Barcaldine, Longreach and the surrounding region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001870"></A>
I can also announce that the final community cabinet of the year will be held on Sunday, 29 November and Monday, 30 November. This will take place at Forest Lake, and I am sure it will attract members of the community from across the western suburbs. Taking government to one of our great outback communities and then following that with a community cabinet in one of our newer Brisbane suburbs is a perfect example of how the community cabinet program operates. I look forward to many more in the future. </Hansard-Body>

National Rugby League Grand Final</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.47 am): Finally, let me talk about rugby league. I think I speak for every Queenslander when I say for too long New South Wales has claimed bragging rights as the heart of rugby league in this country. While it may still be home to a majority of the teams, Queensland has now emerged as the passion state when it comes to the great game of rugby league. Throughout the NRL season Queensland has become hypnotised by the sport. Our three teams are consistently among the best in the country and our fans are the truest through and through. It is time the National Rugby League grand final moved north. Queensland has the fans and the facilities, and we are the best holiday destination in Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1001880"></A>
Our job-creating stadiums are up to twice as popular as those south of the border. The Broncos are averaging around 35,000 people at their home games at Suncorp Stadium. That creates jobs for 1,200 people at the stadium alone. The Gold Coast Titans are attracting an average crowd of more than 18,000 at Skilled Park, and at Dairy Farmers Stadium on average we see more than 16,500 North Queenslanders. In every one of those stadiums the average crowd attendance is above the average crowd attendance for the entire NRL. In Queensland I have no doubt that it will not be too long before we see two Queensland teams go head to head for the rugby league grand final. I have made no secret of the fact that we will be in there fighting hard to get the grand final to Queensland after the current New South Wales contract ends in 2012.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003221"></A>
As David Gallop rightly said yesterday, Queensland will be the frontrunner. Not only do our teams have the backing of long-term Queenslanders, but as 1,000 people move to Queensland every week--the majority from New South Wales and Victoria--fans of southern teams are also hankering to have a final here in the north. </Hansard-Body>

 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.50 am): Australians have one of the longest life expectancies in the world. As medical technology advances and as we understand more about healthy living we are living longer. But the flip side of this is that we are seeing a rapid rise in cancer. This is partly because we are living longer. Men who used to die of old age are now dying of prostate cancer because old age is now older. Part of this is because technology and awareness has improved and we are diagnosing more cancers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003236"></A>
Cancer currently accounts for around a quarter of all Queensland Health treatments. The number of new cancers diagnosed each year is expected to grow by 40 per cent in the next decade. But the good news is that cancer survival rates in Australia and Queensland are amongst the highest in the world. Five-year survival rates for many common cancers are now more than 80 per cent and more than half of all cancers diagnosed are successfully treated.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003237"></A>
Since 2005, the Queensland government has invested more than $463 million in cancer services. This has delivered more than 500 cancer specialist doctors, nurses and allied health workers; an additional 2,500 overnight admissions a year; an additional 21,000 extra ambulatory treatment places per year; an additional 162 palliative care beds; a $6.5 million cancer oncology centre at Rockhampton; $3.1 million in Cairns for six additional chemotherapy chairs; and $5 million to support 19 new cancer treatment drugs which previously were not accessible due to the high cost.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003238"></A>
In the 2009-10 federal budget the Rudd government committed a record $2 billion to provide the infrastructure and support to introduce new and better cancer treatments and improve access to necessary care for patients in rural and regional Australia. As part of this investment, funds from the nation-building Health and Hospitals Fund will be used to support around 10 regional cancer centres, networked across the nation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003240"></A>

Funding of $560 million will be provided to establish new or enhance existing regional cancer centres to optimise outcomes for patients in rural and regional Australia. It takes about an hour to drive from Bendigo or Ballarat to Melbourne, for example. It takes a lot longer in Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003246"></A>
Queensland, as the nation’s most decentralised state, will be working closely with bodies such as Cancer Council Queensland to secure funding for several sites across the state. One of the Bligh government’s core election commitments was to provide $15 million in grant funding to non-government organisations to build or enhance regional accommodation for patients travelling to receive treatment. This included $1 million already granted to the Central Queensland Cancer Support Centre constructed by Cancer Care Queensland and opened by the Minister for Public Works and I recently.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003250"></A>
In July, Queensland Health called for offers from suitable NGOs to build or enhance patient accommodation under this election commitment. A total of nine offers were received. A full evaluation process was undertaken and the director-general has approved seed funding of $100,000 for an initial five organisations. They are the Yumba-Meta Housing Association and the Leukaemia Foundation in Townsville, the Australian Red Cross and the Cancer Council Queensland in Cairns, and the Cancer Council Queensland in Toowoomba. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003252"></A>
This seed funding will allow each organisation to work up the initial planning with an additional $3.5 million in capital funding to be further allocated to assist in either the refurbishment of existing facilities or the construction of accommodation facilities for patients travelling to receive treatment at Queensland Health facilities. Our non-government sector plays a vital role in supporting and caring for Queenslanders suffering from a range of serious conditions, and I am very pleased that we can support them in this work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003253"></A>
The Bligh government is committed to improving and enhancing cancer services throughout the state. I am pleased to announce that we are delivering on this commitment. To use the Rockhampton centre that we opened recently as an example, it is not just a win for Rockhampton in terms of providing further critical mass which we need for cancer treatments in a centre but the cancer accommodation in Rockhampton is really for people who live around Rockhampton and not in Rockhampton. So it provides that win as well. </Hansard-Body>

(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.54 am): I lay upon the table of the House the 2008-09 annual economic report and the 2008-09 report on state finances. </Hansard-Body>

2008-09 Report on State Finances. </Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003258"></A>
These two reports lay out in black and white the carnage visited upon us by the global financial crisis. This is a crisis that has strangled the life out of the global economy, causing the first contraction of global output since World War II. And Queensland has not escaped the violence. Our growth has been close to five per cent on average over the last decade. The global deceleration has reduced that to below one per cent for the financial year 2008-09. But, this is growth, still positive growth of 0.8 per cent, and the result released today is up from the forecast handed down with the 2009-10 budget of half a per cent. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003259"></A>
It is clear that 0.8 per cent is marginal growth, but it remains positive--something most developed economies around the world cannot claim. It is by any measure a remarkable result. Contributing to this growth were the last echoes of the resources boom which boosted investment through the rollout of projects already committed to before the crisis hit in earnest. This is evidenced by business investment which experienced its fifth consecutive year of double digit growth. Critically, public final demand--the measure of government effort, including the building program--grew by 4.6 per cent compared with 2.1 per cent growth in private final demand.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003260"></A>
Its critical importance is underlined by the fact that public final demand contributed 1.1 percentage points to the final growth result. There can be no denying the fact that our nation-leading building program, locked in by this government, helped the Queensland economy stay above the line. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003261"></A>
While we continue to face serious challenges in employment, Queensland actually saw jobs growth of 2.2 per cent over the financial year. But here lies the rub. Queensland’s continued population boom and higher participation rate saw the labour force grow by three per cent offsetting the positive jobs growth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003262"></A>
As I have previously outlined to the House and to the Queensland public, Queensland’s revenues have been dramatically affected by the global recession. At budget time we forecast a massive wipeout in future revenues. The report on state finances details the hits to revenue in 2008-09, with $1.2 billion worth of state taxation revenue forecast at budget gone in the actual wash-up and hits to other areas such as GST of around $740 million.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003263"></A>
When I handed down the 2009-10 budget in June, Treasury forecast a deficit of $574 million for 2008-09. I can report that that outcome has improved. For 2008-09, the final budget operating balance is a surplus of $35 million. This is largely due to some very specific, technical additions to the state’s bottom line that were accounted for at the end of the financial year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003264"></A>
The result has not been driven by a sudden turnaround in revenue outlook. Projected taxation revenue did improve, but only by 1.3 per cent as activity in the economy, and in the housing sector in particular, remains subdued. Final dividends and tax payments from across the entire GOC sector increased. There were also changes to accommodate the treatment of the contribution of land from developments which now includes a valuation of the land underneath roads, reflecting a new national accounting standard--an accounting policy change that boosted the final audited result by some $322 million. If not for the accounting change to value land under roads, the quantum of these contributions would be less than $100 million. Actual operating expenses were slightly below those forecast in June, while an increase in Commonwealth grants revenue of $168 million was also recorded.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003265"></A>
It is important to emphasise that this surplus result is a substantial improvement, and a welcome one. It does not mean, however, that Queensland has defeated the global recession and victory can be declared. We face many continued challenges, most particularly, we are largely facing a ‘revenueless recovery’ which means that our key revenues, such as transfer duty, payroll tax and coal royalties, are flatlining, if not decreasing, in the near term. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003266"></A>
As our farmers and our tourism industries will attest, a rising Australian dollar is not all good news. For the state, given coal companies write their export contracts in US dollars, a rising Aussie dollar is a revenue risk. For every 1c rise in the Aussie dollar, the impact is $27 million off our royalties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003267"></A>
Yet a sense of optimism is prudent in these circumstances. Queensland’s fundamentals remain strong. Our trading partners are forecast to return to growth during the second half of next year and, as I have mentioned, we have maintained strong population growth as people demonstrate their faith in our prospects.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003268"></A>
It is fair to say that the global recession has put the brakes on growth. Queensland, in my view, will be in the future, as it has been for so long, a key driver of the nation’s economic performance. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (9.59 am): I rise to make a ministerial statement and table the report into an investigation regarding a tragic level crossing accident.</Hansard-Body>

 Final report, Rail Safety Investigation QT2459, fatal collision between the Cairns tilt train and B-double truck, Rungoo level crossing, Queensland, 27 November 2008. </Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003307"></A>
On 27 November last year, two QR train drivers were killed when the Cairns tilt train collided with a B-double truck at Rungoo, north of Ingham. My department instigated a full, independent, no-blame investigation under the Transport Infrastructure Act 1994 to identify the cause of the collision and make recommendations to improve safety. The investigation was chaired by an investigator from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. It examined all aspects of the crash from obtaining eyewitness accounts to complex engineering and technical advice. The police investigation is separate and, I am advised, ongoing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003311"></A>
The investigation found that the primary cause of the crash was that the truck driver failed to respond to the flashing lights at the crossing. By the time he saw the train approaching, he was not physically able to stop in time to avoid a collision. Eyewitness accounts and subsequent testing confirm that the warning lights were operational. The report notes that the driver says that he did not see the flashing lights. It finds that the driver may have been experiencing a degree of fatigue which could have affected his performance and that he ‘had a poor driving history in terms of licence suspension due to an accumulation of demerit points for speeding and logbook irregularities’. The investigation also confirmed that the level crossing was essentially compliant with the relevant standards and that neither the truck nor the train had any defects.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003313"></A>
During the investigation QR temporarily suspended service of the Cairns tilt train while additional information on the safety of the cab structure was sought. The report found that, even if the train had been built to higher standards, it is unlikely that the survivable space in the cabin would have been significantly greater.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003314"></A>
The report proposes a number of safety actions. First, it recommends that the Australian Transport Council further investigate intelligent systems to monitor heavy vehicle speed and compliance. I will raise this at the ATC meeting in Sydney next week. Second, it suggests that my department take further steps to ensure drug testing of drivers involved in serious crashes. I commit to that review being undertaken in conjunction with police. Third, it recommends that Queensland Rail make policy changes around passenger manifests and how to respond to offers of medical assistance. I have written to the CEO of QR on those matters today. I can also advise the House that work is continuing on the Rungoo crossing to improve safety, with boom gates to be installed by mid-November.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003315"></A>
This was a tragic incident which led to the loss of two lives and which has caused distress to the many people involved. I offer my sincere condolences to the family, friends and co-workers of the two men who passed away. </Hansard-Body>

Gateway Upgrade Project</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CA WALLACE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Thuringowa--ALP) (Minister for Main Roads) (10.03 am): I have good news for Queensland. I would like to inform the House that the final 3.5-metre gap in the main span of the second Gateway Bridge was closed overnight, bringing the $1.88 billion Gateway Upgrade Project another step closer to completion. Last night 75 cubic metres of concrete was poured into the final piece of formwork, marking the completion of the 1.63-kilometre bridge superstructure. This follows two concrete pours earlier this month to close the 2.5-metre gaps between the side spans and the northern and southern approaches to the bridge.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003320"></A>
This is a great achievement, considering that construction of the four 130-metre cantilever spans only began in February this year. A total of 25 workers were involved in the operation, which took about five hours to complete, finishing around midnight. Over the past eight months a team of 80 workers have cast 123 concrete segments. Now that the final section of concrete has been poured, the 260-metre main river span will be stressed using high-tensile steel cables to hold the two ends of the superstructure firmly together. The focus will then turn to finishing works, which include the installation of concrete barriers, lighting, safety screens and fire mains, asphalt surfacing, line marking and the completion of the dedicated pedestrian and cycle paths. The project is ahead of schedule, with the bridge scheduled to be completed by mid next year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003321"></A>
Following the opening of the new bridge to southbound traffic by the middle of next year, refurbishment of the existing Gateway Bridge will be carried out as well as the completion of other features of the project. Three northbound lanes will remain open to traffic on the existing bridge during the refurbishment, which is expected to take about seven months. Once complete, all Queenslanders will be able to celebrate the achievements of the project, as the twin bridges are lit up with permanent themed lighting and features unmatched by any bridge of this size in Australia. As a centrepiece project in the government’s current $18.2 billion road infrastructure plan, the Gateway Upgrade Project is protecting our Queensland lifestyle through more reliable, safer and easier travel on the Gateway Motorway. </Hansard-Body>

Altruistic Surrogacy</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (10.05 am): Existing laws in Queensland prevent couples from using altruistic surrogacy as a last-resort option to create a family. This is a situation that the Bligh government is determined to address. As part of our commitment to resolving this issue, in August 2009 the government released for public comment a position paper outlining our reforms to the law relating to surrogacy, namely, to decriminalise altruistic surrogacy but to continue to make commercial surrogacy arrangements illegal. This model received support from an overwhelming majority of stakeholders and commentators. The government has now prepared a draft bill, taking into account the feedback and input we received. This legislation will have a significant effect on people’s lives and I now table for the benefit of all members and interested Queenslanders the consultation draft of the Surrogacy Bill 2009 and the explanatory notes.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003325"></A>
This bill heralds a new era for Queensland couples. These reforms mean that many people who once only ever dreamt of starting a family will now be able to make those dreams a reality. Under the bill, a surrogacy arrangement is where a birth mother agrees to become pregnant and for the child born as a result of this arrangement to be treated as the child of another person or persons--the intended parents. The parties involved in an altruistic surrogacy arrangement who wish to seek an order from the court to transfer the legal parentage of the child must meet certain strict requirements. Among others, these include satisfying the court that the parties have undergone counselling, received independent legal advice and have established a medical or social need for the surrogacy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003326"></A>
This legislation demonstrates the Bligh government’s commitment to social reform, equality and the importance of family. The bill and explanatory notes will be available on the parliamentary website as well as the Justice website at justice.qld.gov.au. I anticipate that the final version of the bill will be introduced into the Legislative Assembly in late November. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. D BOYLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships) (10.07 am): I am pleased to inform the House that today I will table the first annual report of the Family Responsibilities Commission. As a key plank of the Cape York welfare reform trial, it links parental responsibility with welfare assistance to restore Indigenous authority and social norms in the trial communities of Aurukun, Hope Vale, Coen and Mossman Gorge. It is not just about school attendance, as important as that is. What a parent has to do under the new arrangements is to make sure that their children are fed, that they have a good night’s sleep and that they get off to school in the morning ready to learn. Over the past 12 months the commission has held 951 conferences and referred 616 people to support services, with nearly 280 undertaking programs such as anger management and alcohol treatment. There were also 89 orders for conditional income management.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003335"></A>
Today’s annual report shows that positive things are happening in the trial communities. The commission reports that people are coming forward voluntarily--people such as pensioners and carers--and asking for their income to be managed to help them meet their family’s needs. The Bligh government joins the Family Responsibilities Commission in asking the Commonwealth for the necessary administrative flexibility to enable voluntary income management to happen.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004867"></A>
I would like to share with the House the story of Alice--which is not her real name to protect her identity. This young woman from one of these communities has kindly given permission for her story to be shared in the hope of influencing others. Alice is a client of the commission who is subject to conditional income management and has almost completed her case plan. At first Alice said she was very unhappy, and even angry, about having her income managed. After going through the commission, completing an alcohol management program and getting a job for three days a week Alice says she now has many reasons to smile. She enjoys spending time with her children, has money to buy food and even has some money put away for a rainy day. She says she is planning her next job move to work as a landscaper or maybe even a ranger. </Hansard-Body>

Coen local commissioner, Garry Port, reports that children in his community are coming to school prepared and they are learning. Commissioner Port says that attendance is up, students’ education standards are starting to fall into place and they themselves can see the importance of learning. Stories like Commissioner Port’s and Alice’s are as stirring as they are real. Without doubt one of the biggest strengths in this trial is the local commissioners, elders and community leaders who are working behind the scenes every day to get their residents on and up. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (10.11 am): The Bligh government is helping create a smarter and greener Queensland. This year we have been making our schools more sustainable by installing solar panels and energy efficient lighting. Since July, 167 schools have had solar panels installed and 314 schools have had energy efficient lighting installed. By March 2010 more than 600 schools will have solar panels, energy efficient lighting and an information technology data system installed through this partnership with the federal government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004875"></A>
It is also a program that is creating jobs; more than 463 jobs statewide, in fact. It is because of our commitment to programs and partnerships like this one that the Bligh government is continuing to create and support Queensland jobs. But we are also improving education standards through projects like this. Getting students more engaged with science is one of our key goals because we know this will help boost their achievements. We need to find new and innovative ways to get them interested and keep them studying science. The solar energy efficiency program gives students a real-life view of what is actually happening up there on the roof and in the lights.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004876"></A>
Each school’s solar panels and lighting come with a smart meter. These smart meters collect data on electricity generation and consumption. It is a great way for students to see how they are saving energy, to learn how the technology works and why it is so important. Teachers will be able to use their own school’s data to explore topical issues such as greenhouse gas emissions and sustainable energy use. This is a great program for Queensland: it creates jobs, it saves energy and it helps students learn and love science. As we enter the Year of Sustainability in 2010 I look forward to seeing schools all over Queensland reaping even more benefits from this wonderful partnership. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (10.12 am): It is fair to say that for some time we have witnessed emotionally charged and exaggerated allegations that our wild rivers initiative is a deliberate strategy to shut down economic opportunities for Indigenous communities in Cape York. This is demonstrably untrue. The Wild Rivers Act is a visionary approach to protecting some of Australia’s most ecologically healthy river systems. There are few countries in the world that can boast having rivers in such pristine condition.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1004880"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would just remind the House that the opposition actually supported our wild rivers legislation. Our overarching intent is to ensure that any new development within a wild river basin does not impact on those natural values that make these rivers so special. But does that mean opportunities for new jobs grind to a halt? The answer is an emphatic no. It is disappointing that so much that has been written has clearly not been informed by the declarations that are publicly available on my department’s website. Any reasonable consideration of these documents reveal new projects are, in fact, encouraged providing that the rivers are not unduly impacted upon. This is not unreasonable and is not so different from the protection afforded to any other waterway in any other part of Australia. Activities including mining, grazing, fishing and ecotourism can all still occur. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004881"></A>
The declarations explain how and where such work can occur. For example, within a high-preservation area, which is the area immediately adjoining a river, there are no constraints on grazing activities. Similarly, the construction and maintenance of outstations, roads and facilities for tourism are also not prohibited in the HPAs. However, intensive agriculture, animal husbandry, in-stream dams and weirs, surface mining and aquaculture are restricted in the most sensitive areas. But even these activities can proceed if there is a property development plan which ensures appropriate environmental safeguards are in place. In such ecologically sensitive areas, this approach to development assessment is not too much to ask. The act also ensures traditional Indigenous activities such as hunting and fishing can still occur and native title rights are protected and respected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004882"></A>
We are committed to preserving the unique biodiversity of the cape while also creating jobs in cape communities. That is why we have introduced a range of specific initiatives to facilitate indigenous economic opportunities. Last year we released the Cape York and Torres Strait Tourism Action Plan, developed with Indigenous communities to encourage the growth of the tourism industry. In 2007 the Cape York Peninsula Heritage Act was enacted to clearly recognise the importance of ensuring an appropriate balance between the preservation of the cape’s unique culture and environment and the legitimate economic aspirations of Indigenous communities. For example, this act requires specific Indigenous water reserves be set aside in a wild river to enable communities to pursue opportunities for job creating projects that require a water allocation. We are also employing Indigenous people across the Cape and Gulf in our unique wild rivers ranger program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004883"></A>
An informed debate to encourage improvements in Indigenous health, education, employment and business opportunities on Cape York is always welcome. Meeting the challenge of Closing the Gap demands a robust debate about identifying the best ways forward. But that debate must also be factual otherwise too much time is wasted on having to correct the record. </Hansard-Body>

Building Services Authority, Unlicensed Contractors</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.16 am): Recently a Brisbane resident wrote to me regarding an unregistered business called Discount Roofing. This business has placed advertising billboards on power poles and in other public places advertising that a roof can be painted with two coats of acrylic paint for $895. This business is not licensed and, as far as I am concerned, consumers should not be using them. Consumers should always use a licensed contractor because the licence indicates that the contractor has met certain minimum standards. I will be asking the Building Services Authority to pursue this unlicensed company.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004887"></A>
Our home is likely to be the single biggest asset most individuals own. Any investment made in that home should not be risked in the hands of an unlicensed contractor. A critical role of the BSA, and in particular over the past 12 months given the economic climate, is to target unlicensed contracting. The BSA has performed a number of unlicensed contracting blitzes over the past 12 months. These blitzes have included targeting unlicensed contractors advertising to do building work through media outlets and conducting licensing audits to detect unlicensed contractors who unlawfully perform building work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004888"></A>
The BSA was extremely active on this front last financial year. Some 1,175 investigations into non-compliant advertisements were conducted, which has resulted in 212 infringements notices being issued. The BSA also investigated complaints made by consumers and BSA licensed contractors with some 639 investigations undertaken into allegations of unlicensed contracting resulting in 525 infringement notices being issued.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004889"></A>
Two licensing audits were conducted during the year with 7,470 contractors being interviewed at 1,916 building sites. It is pleasing that out of all these audits only 120 people were suspected of not holding an appropriate licence. It shows that there is indeed a great awareness and compliance with this system. The rate of unlicensed contractors detected has remained relatively steady over the last couple of years at approximately 2.5 percent. I urge consumers and members of this House to assist in removing these rogues and cowboys from the industry by simply not using unlicensed contractors and warning constituents not to do so. Consumers should check to ensure that contractors are licensed before engaging such individuals to do building work. Consumers should always check their contractor’s BSA card and then perform a licence check on the BSA’s online licence search before signing a contract. I urge the media to highlight Discount Roofing as an unlicensed contractor.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.19 am): I am sure all honourable members would agree that threatening or attacking paramedics while they are performing their duties is a despicable act. These dedicated men and women attend incidents to render first aid to those who need it, not to act as punching bags. One hundred and seven incidents of assault were self-reported by ambulance officers last financial year--a very disturbing figure. A further 35 reports have been lodged so far this financial year. One assault is one too many. The Bligh government has taken a hard line, changing the Criminal Code 12 months ago so that such attacks are deemed serious assaults which carry a maximum penalty of seven years in jail. This change covers any public officer, whether they be a paramedic, firefighter or child safety officer, while they are performing their duties.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006481"></A>
I am pleased to announced today a pilot program on tactical communication training which will be offered to all operational paramedics in the state. The training includes tactical communication, situational awareness, conflict dynamics, a safety philosophy, open hand tactics and tactical withdrawal. The training pilot is scheduled to start in December and will be undertaken initially in the Brisbane metropolitan region. It is about giving paramedics the training they need to get out of dangerous situations where they feel their security is threatened. It will complement personal safety training that ambulance officers already receive during their training to enter the service.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006482"></A>
Tactical communication training is yet another way officers can protect themselves in the field. Already paramedics who feel at risk can request the assistance of the police through discreet radio codes. In South-East Queensland, operational ambulances are fitted with duress buttons and automatic vehicle location technology. The safety and security of our front-line emergency services personnel is a fundamental priority of the Bligh government. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (10.21 am): The Bligh government went to the last election with a promise to build Queensland out of these tough times. Furthermore, we promised to support the Queensland tourism industry through $36 million in additional funding. The Bligh government also listened to the various drive tourism and regional tourism stakeholder groups that called for new and improved roadside tourism infrastructure. That is why we promised $1.8 million in roadside tourism infrastructure projects.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006490"></A>
I am happy to say that my department has already received a number of applications for infrastructure projects to help boost the state’s drive tourism market. Round 1 of the $600,000 Regional Minor Tourism Infrastructure Grants Program has been extremely popular, with applications from local councils, regional tourism organisations and local community groups. These applications have included requests for shaded picnic areas, tourism signage and other amenities in shires neighbouring the Matilda Highway, Pacific Coast Touring Route, the Country Way, Overlander’s Way, Savannah Way and Outback Way.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006499"></A>
The drive tourism market is worth more than $4 billion to Queensland and accounts for around 70 per cent of the overnight leisure market. Considering the size of our state, existing facilities and infrastructure can be many kilometres apart, and that is something we can improve on. That is why this grant program is targeting regions that are popular for driving holidays and special interest experiences. It is all about making the experience more comfortable for the grey nomads, backpackers and other visitors.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006500"></A>
I have appointed an industry consultative committee made up of representatives of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council, the Local Government Association of Queensland, the Campervan and Motorhome Club of Australia and an independent tourism planner to recommend projects. They will independently ensure the highest priority projects are funded to cater for the drive tourism market. These projects will not only provide tourism benefits but also support local jobs during their construction. The government has delivered more than $1.5 billion in tourism infrastructure whereas the last time the opposition was in power it had an infrastructure freeze. The Bligh government is united in its dedication to Queensland and is delivering on its promises. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (10.23 am): I am pleased to announce today that the Bligh government will be contributing $300,000 to purchase the Cromarty Wetlands in North Queensland. These wetlands will be guaranteed perpetual protection as a result of the purchase, which is a great result for all of North Queensland. I want to start by acknowledging the Townsville trio--the honourable member for Thuringowa, the member for Townsville and the member for Mundingburra--who have been tireless in their representations to the state government about this purchase. They have done a great job in advocating on behalf of the wetlands group. At the request of the member for Townsville, I recently met with the Wetlands and Grasslands Foundation to discuss the merits of securing this area for future generations. I congratulate the member for Townsville on her advocacy and on this great outcome today.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006509"></A>
It is a significant site, covering over 1,600 hectares. That is 2,000 footy fields; I thought that the member for Thuringowa could relate to that. It is recognised as an important environment and natural tourism asset for this region. These wetlands provide a very good quality habitat for at least eight species that are listed as rare or threatened. Many bird species use this complex variety of habitats which include rainforest, open forest and swamps. This site is also home to the largest concentration of brolga recorded in Australia, with around 12,000 birds. It is also a very important breeding site for magpie geese. It is surrounded by protected areas on all but the southern end, so this purchase will prevent the fragmentation of a vital ecosystem.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006511"></A>
This funding is being announced today because the Wetlands and Grasslands Foundation has an option to purchase the site up until 31 October when this option expires. Our funding is contingent upon other cash contributions being secured by the foundation and the success of the National Reserve System application, which is currently before the Commonwealth government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006514"></A>
I was encouraged to see in the <Hansard-Italic>
Townsville Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 today that the Townsville City Council and the Burdekin Shire Council have also pledged $250,000 combined. The entire area is intended to be managed for nature conservation purposes and become part of Queensland’s ever-expanding protected area estate. It will be a welcome contribution to our 2020 target of achieving 20 million hectares of protected area estate across Queensland. I want to extend my congratulations to the member for Townsville, the other Townsville members, the foundation and also Townsville Enterprise. A lot of fundraising has been carried out by local businesses in support of this. I and the government want to see that that work pays off. We are putting our money where our mouth is. </Hansard-Body>

Hon. A PALASZCZUK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Inala--ALP) (Minister for Disability Services and Multicultural Affairs) (10.26 am): I recently had the pleasure of launching the Blue Skies Scenario in Brisbane on behalf of National Disability Services. Blue Skies offers a unique blueprint for building a truly inclusive society for people with a disability. The vision has been developed by people with a disability, parent advocates, service providers and government representatives. The Bligh government is working with the disability services sector to make this vision a reality. That is why the Premier has asked me to develop a 10-year plan for the future of disability services. I will be meeting with major stakeholders about developing this plan over the next few months.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006523"></A>
The government’s vision is about ensuring that people with a disability have the same opportunities as all Queenslanders. It is about catering for the diverse needs of people with disability in every aspect of their lives. This means ensuring that they have equality in education, employment, housing and recreation. Over the past decade, it has been Queensland Labor governments that have increased funding for disability services from $250 million a year to more than $900 million a year. We support the Blue Skies vision and we want to take disability services in Queensland to the next level.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006524"></A>
The government will pay close attention to the Blue Skies Scenario in formulating our 10-year plan. At the heart of this plan is a recognition that people with a disability have a right to an ‘ordinary life’. An ‘ordinary life’ is not just about the delivery of specialist disability services; it is about better access to transport, education, health care, employment and retail, tourism and recreational opportunities. It is about equality. A fully inclusive community is something that we need to create together. Queenslanders with a disability and their families and carers can rest assured that the Bligh government is sparing no efforts to build a more inclusive community for all people throughout Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LANGBROEK </Hansard-Member-Up>
(10.30 am): My first question without notice is to the Premier. On 6 October the Premier told this House, ‘I can advise the member that no member of my jobs task force at those meetings has ever raised the issue or raised any concerns with privatisation.’ Jobs Squad member Ron Monaghan has labelled the Premier’s privatisation plan ‘magic pudding economics’ and said, ‘The person in the street would be misled if they took the government’s spin at face value.’ Does the Premier still stand by her comment of 6 October that Ron Monaghan has never raised this issue with her at these meetings? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006574"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. The opposition of Ron Monaghan and a number of unions associated with the Queensland Council of Unions to the government’s plan to sell some assets is well known, is on the public record and is well established. Watch television and you will see it. It is not secret opposition. They are not keeping it to themselves. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006576"></A>
The question that I was asked was whether this had been raised as part of the Jobs Squad activities. Mr Monaghan has not raised this at the Jobs Squad. It has not been a subject of any agenda item at meetings. Of course Mr Monaghan has raised it with me at every other opportunity he has had. I can barely ring the man without having a discussion about it. There is absolutely no secret that the unions have a very entrenched ideological opposition to this. There is no secret about that. As I said, turn on your television, turn on your radio, open your newspaper and you will find out about their views on it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006577"></A>
The agenda items at the Jobs Squad have included practical ways to take the regulatory burden off business where possible and have included how to create new opportunities to ensure that we do not see a lost generation of young people unable to get apprenticeships and traineeships. We have seen an opportunity to talk about how to best deploy new resources from government like the Green Army and how we can work with the Commonwealth government’s targeted employment zones. Mr Monaghan has been an active participant in all of those discussions, as we would expect him to be, as indeed have representatives of the Australian Workers Union who have been at those meetings.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006578"></A>
I welcome the question from the opposition about the work of the Jobs Squad. I met with them last week. They are, as always, a group of people who deeply care about not only the strength of the Queensland economy but much more importantly the lives and working opportunities for ordinary Queenslanders who are threatened by the global financial crisis. </Hansard-Body>

 I note the continued view of those opposite that privatisation will not lead to growth in jobs. I have more faith in the private sector than they have obviously. I believe that private investment will grow jobs in coal. How are we going to have more coal go to port unless we have more train drivers and more coal wagons? This is about building Queensland Rail. Queensland Rail is a great Queensland organisation and our plans will see it go from strength to strength. There will be more jobs for Queenslanders in Queensland Rail--more jobs for train drivers, more jobs for rail workers, more jobs for those in the workshops. </Hansard-Body>

 My second question without notice is also to the Premier.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I do not have all the words that the Leader of the Opposition is referring to in front of me. When I identify it, I am happy to have a look at it. What we have put into the public arena--and it is a fact--is that what constitutes less than one per cent of revenue is the revenue gained from those assets which we intend to put into the market. It is very clear. There is a view out there perpetrated by those opposite that GOCs are cash cows for the government, that they are running the entire budget of government--nothing could be further from the truth. Sure, it is great to have income from any source, but the revenue from these assets constitutes less than one per cent of revenue to the government’s coffers. That is a fact and I am happy for Queenslanders to know it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006591"></A>
Again, we have those opposite whingeing and moaning, complaining and criticising. All they can do is outline the problem. They never have one single idea for themselves. Where is the shadow Treasurer’s alternative economic plan for Queensland? It does not exist. He does not have one. Where is the the Leader of the Opposition’s alternative economic strategy for Queensland? He does not have one. It does not exist. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006592"></A>
As I outlined this morning, our plan is absolutely clear. We will keep building the infrastructure that Queensland needs and we have the courage to take the tough decisions to make that happen. We know that those opposite would cut that building plan. They think that now is a time when Queensland needs fewer roads not more, fewer hospitals, fewer schools. We disagree. We have population growth and we are going to get ahead of that growth and deliver the services and projects that Queenslanders need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008634"></A>
We are building new industries. The work that is happening in the liquefied natural gas industry is building an entire new export sector for this state. If we look at the aviation, biotechnology and ICT industries--all of those new and emerging industries--we will find Queensland government incentives and Queensland government investment programs driving growth in employment and creating jobs. Our plan for jobs is clear. What is equally clear is that those opposite have none. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs KIERNAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier. Can the Premier inform the House of the opportunities that the LNG industry presents to Queensland and what her government is doing to make this industry a reality? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006598"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The state government of Queensland is not only committed to maintaining our massive building program and keeping and protecting the jobs that it relies on but also committed to building new industries wherever there is an opportunity to do so. We have worked very diligently over the last couple of years with proponents who are seeking to open up an entire new export sector for Queensland. We have provided certainty to those proponents about royalty regimes, we have provided certainty on location for proposed plants and we have provided certainty on approval processes. We have put in place a regime for environmental requirements, particularly in relation to the management of waste water from any of these processes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006600"></A>
What we have seen today is the announcement by one of the proponents to put in place a significant level of investment that will be dedicated to creating jobs in new areas where we currently do not have skills anywhere in the country, particularly not in the quantities that are needed, and, commendably, a program to ensure that those opportunities go to young people through apprenticeships and up to 300 Indigenous Queenslanders through their Indigenous employment program. What does all of that mean? It means jobs for Queenslanders. Potentially, when all of these proponents come to reality, it could mean up to a $3 billion increase in gross state product. That is worth working for. It is worth chasing. It is worth being passionate about--and that is what this government is delivering. What does a gross state product increase of $3 billion mean? It means that we can employ more teachers, more police on the front line, more nurses in our hospitals, more ambulance officers, more firefighters--more of what Queenslanders need. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008647"></A>
What is the alternative from the opposition? As I have said, we know they will cut the building program. We also know that they want a three per cent cut on jobs like teachers, police, ambulance and firefighters. What they have admitted since the last sitting of parliament is that, while we have a target of 100,000 new jobs, their jobs target is zero. They have a zero target; their jobs target is zero. If the LNP were in government, LNG would mean ‘Look, No Growth’, because they would be taking us backward at a rate of three per cent every year. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPRINGBORG:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. I refer to moves within the Labor Party to boot out Labor member and ETU organiser Stu Traill for opposing the Premier on privatisation. Will Labor’s former state president, Ron Monaghan, also be booted out of the Labor Party, or is it a fact that Mr Monaghan is only mouthing opposition to privatisation in public and saying something else behind closed doors? </Hansard-Body>

 I thank the honourable member for the question. I am not aware of any moves to cancel the membership of any member of the Australian Labor Party on this or indeed any other issue. One thing I can say about the Australian Labor Party is that it is a very broad church. As uncomfortable as the church might be, it is a very broad one. It has a remarkable elasticity. </Hansard-Body>

 I say to our guests from Vanuatu that this is typical of a Thursday, I am afraid to say. I thank the member for the question. She, like other members from the Gold Coast, understands that tourism, and particularly international tourism, is one of the lifebloods of this wonderful part of our state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006671"></A>
In 2006, the then tourism minister, Margaret Keech, travelled to Malaysia to convince AirAsia X to establish a new route to the Gold Coast rather than to Melbourne. I am pleased to say that she succeeded, and since then the route was launched in November 2007 and passenger movements have grown significantly. AirAsia X had 56,000 passengers travelling to the Gold Coast this year, which is 73 per cent up on the same time last year. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006675"></A>
Our government, through the current tourism minister Peter Lawlor’s efforts recently, has worked with this airline to develop marketing campaigns in Malaysia to help grow this route. I am pleased today to advise the House that AirAsia X will again increase its commitment to Queensland. From February next year, it will start operating daily services from Kuala Lumpur to the Gold Coast, lifting its number of flights from six to seven. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006677"></A>
So while we have been getting on with the business of scoring goals for the Gold Coast, of kicking goals for the Gold Coast, what have we seen from those members opposite? We have had a week where they have plotted to undermine a great car race, following on from a year where they have opposed the Carrara stadium. While we are on the attack for the Gold Coast, they are holding down the tackled player. What we want is a free-flowing game, but they are not even playing the same game.

 My question is to the Treasurer. Today’s tabled report on state finances shows that Labor has delivered the worst net debt position since figures have been kept in Queensland--it is up there on this diagram. Will the Treasurer now admit that debt is in Labor’s DNA?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006683"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the shadow Treasurer for the question, because this government through the last couple of months, and indeed most particularly this week, in the public arena has been pretty forthright about our views on what is required to address the pressures on the state’s balance sheet. We are out there with a plan. We have a plan to address this issue and we have delivered today a result on the 2008-09 year which is improved on what happened at budget time. Nevertheless, where is the starting point on this debate for LNP members? Their starting point is to say that this is not the issue, that an improved position should not be acknowledged. What do they offer in return? Silence. Silence is all we hear. What do we see from the Leader of the Opposition? Acres of nothingness. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006684"></A>
What is the myth? That they have got a plan. What is the fact? That they have got no plan. What is the myth? That the member for Surfers Paradise will continue to be the leader of the LNP to the next election. What is the fact? We know that he will not. What is the myth? That they do not really believe in privatisation. What is the fact? That it is absolutely part of what they believe.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006685"></A>
What has the shadow Treasurer said in this House on the record? Not only that he supports privatisation, but in a debate on electricity he wanted to go further and sell the poles and wires business as well. What is the fact? That is their view. What is the myth? That they do not believe in privatisation. What is the fact? What does the commission of audit say? That they supported in government selling the motorways, selling the ports, selling the forest. What is the myth? That they did not believe this before the last election. What is the fact? That they had it in their policy platform before the election. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006687"></A>
What is the myth? The myth is that there are Liberals still left in this state. What is the fact? There are none of them left. As I said yesterday, it is a bit early for me to start on the concept of saying ‘I remember when’, but I remember when there used to be Liberals in this state. I remember when there used to be people who were actually able to contribute to policy development, when the Liberal Party in this state used to be the vanguard of promoting reform. They have been wiped out, rolled over by the old policy dinosaurs in the Nats. We can see that in their attitude to climate change, where they deny it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006688"></A>
Last week in the parliament the Leader of the Opposition did not even have the guts to ask a question without notice in the chamber which denied climate change. He slipped it in on the <Hansard-Italic>
Notice Paper</Hansard-Italic>
 so that he could go and dog whisper to everybody about how he does not support a CPRS. What we see from both their stance on this and from their stance on climate change is the death of the Liberal Party. The reality is that this government has a plan. We are putting it forward. What do you hear from the opposition? Nought. </Hansard-Body>

 I withdraw it, Mr Speaker. They complete a masters level qualification, they can order diagnostics like X-rays, and they can prescribe some medications and issue referrals. People have made a few comments in this place about the level of qualifications of nurse practitioners compared to others. As well as a three-year undergraduate degree that a nurse completes, their masters degree is often in the vicinity of 12 months to 18 months, together with extensive practical experience that takes place usually in between the undergraduate and the masters degrees. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It was a lot better day than when you got knocked off as Leader of the Opposition. You clearly go to hospitals with preconceived views based on what you read about the relationship between doctors and nurses. One of the things that has absolutely gratified me is the way that our doctors, nurses and nurse practitioners work in a team in places such as EDs. There are only a couple of troglodytes on the other side of the House who want to traduce the reputation of nurse practitioners. They are a wonderful part of our team. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008700"></A>
In the past, the career structure for nursing after becoming a senior on the floor was to go to an administrative position. Any health practitioner will tell you--and we have a number here who are doctors--that they still have the yearn and the desire to be treating people. It is something they always want to do. Nurse practitioner positions offer a professional career structure that allows nurses to continue to have their hands on people to treat them. That is a very important aspect of it. We will see more development of the skills and roles of all of our professions in health, not less. Other people want restrictive work; we do not.</Hansard-Body>

Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Health. The Park is a high-security mental health facility near Brisbane housing the most dangerous murderers and child rapists. Can the minister explain why, despite a security review undertaken earlier this year due to security locks repeatedly failing, on 9 September the external electronic doors failed twice and spontaneously opened and that, instead of fixing the locks, nurses are now required to check them every two hours? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008707"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take a significant interest in any allegation of the nature of security issues with respect to secure facilities. I am aware there was concern expressed that when the electrical storm happened the other night there was a malfunction. Clearly, that matter has to be investigated. One should remember, however, that even an electronic system has to have a fail-safe but also a system whereby in certain circumstances they will not continue to lock. For example, if you rely on electronic security and there is a fire and it defaults to a mechanism whereby it continues to be locked, then you can in a secure facility risk real difficulties. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008708"></A>
One of the things about electronic systems is that there is always a role in appropriate circumstances for human testing of those systems. For example, we have electronic signalling in our rail system. That does not obviate the need for professionals or railway workers to deal with the human aspects of safety. Checking something, notwithstanding that it is electronically controlled, is not in any sense a bad thing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008709"></A>
I am very keen to understand the circumstances surrounding that. Clearly, when lightning strikes happen we have all seen in various places that systems are sometimes damaged. That depends on the nature of it. It is not just a power failure but a symptom of the strike. Where the strike took place, I do not know. Clearly, they are matters of legitimate concern raised by the honourable member. I am keen to have Queensland Health address them. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008718"></A>
I tabled the annual economic report in the parliament earlier today. That revealed that the performance of the labour market had been under pressure over the last 12 months. What happened in the Queensland labour market is very clear. Everyone should understand that, while unemployment was being visited around the world, while unemployment was on the march through all developed economies and unemployment certainly moved to 4.4 per cent--slightly above the forecast in Queensland--what was going on in the Queensland economy was job creation. Job creation was occurring at a rate of 2.2 per cent--twice the rate of the rest of Australia. Forty-eight thousand jobs were created in the Queensland economy last year in net terms. </Hansard-Body>

I invite them at this point to yell out across the chamber what is their job creation target. What is their job creation target? They do not have one. Their job creation target is to expunge 12,000 workers--doctors, teachers and the sorts of people who are providing services to the people of Queensland every day--because they learned nothing on 21 March. They abide the three per cent cut to wipe out public sector employment. They continue to have no job creation target. All they do is wring their hands about the problem, and at the first whiff of having to do something they quiver and run away. </Hansard-Body>

Go Cards</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<A ID="pgfId-1010816"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms SIMPSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Transport. Will the minister confirm that the reason seven out of 10 commuters reject go cards is their limited availability due to many newsagents being blocked from selling go cards, thus leaving major shopping centres, including Toombul, and whole towns without an outlet?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010818"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I note that just recently the member for Maroochydore issued a press release on this very matter claiming that it is incredibly difficult to get your hands on a go card and claiming that in Ipswich, for instance, there was only one go card outlet. In fact, in Ipswich I think there are nine go card outlets. People can get them at 7-Eleven stores, at the Ipswich Railway Station and, of course, over the phone and online.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010820"></A>
Nonetheless, I take it from the question that the member for Maroochydore supports the sensational product that is go card, understands why 460,000 people so far have bought one and supports the government’s stated policy of getting 100 per cent take-up of go cards by the end of next year. In order to do that, as the government has already announced, we intend to double the number of outlets at which people can buy a go card. We have already announced that we plan to roll out a seniors card that doubles as a go card so that older people can access this technology with the greatest of ease. We intend to rollout 400,000 go cards with $10 of free credit.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

The go card is a sensational product. Unlike Sydney and Melbourne, which are still struggling to get a smart card technology, in Queensland there has been a great take-up rate of this product. Tens of thousands of people every day are using this product to get on and off buses in three seconds rather than 11 seconds. Some 50 million trips have so far been taken using go cards. One and a quarter million trips a week are taken using go cards. More than half of all trips in peak times are go card trips. The people of Queensland who use this product swear by it. We are ultimately committed to rolling it out to the remainder of public transport users. When the Gold Coast light rail is built, the people of the Gold Coast will be able to use their go card on the light rail system. I note that a day after I challenged the Leader of the Opposition to remove his name from the Stop Light Rail website he has failed to do so.</Hansard-Body>

Wild Rivers Ranger Program</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010831"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WETTENHALL:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade. Would the minister please outline the progress of the government’s wild rivers ranger program?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010834"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Barron River for his question and acknowledge his abiding interest in initiatives to create employment in Far North Queensland, including Cape York. The wild rivers ranger program currently employs 20 Indigenous rangers across the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape York to look after Queensland’s declared wild rivers. These rivers are of outstanding national and international significance in terms of their natural and cultural features. The job of the wild rivers rangers is to keep them that way by preventing wild fires, invasive weeds and feral animals, land disturbance, rubbish and water pollution. This very successful wild rivers ranger program will be expanded this financial year with additional funding of $5 million over four years to employ an additional 10 rangers. Rangers deliver on this government’s election commitment to protect some of Queensland’s most magnificent natural assets. That is exactly what these wild rivers rangers are doing.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010838"></A>
In the 2008-09 financial year the rangers program offered dozens of activities including treating over 3,000 hectares of weed infested country, eradicating in excess of 2,700 wild pigs, undertaking fire control management on 20,000 hectares using a combination of contemporary and traditional burning practices, erecting five kilometres of fencing of wetlands to keep out cattle and pigs, undertaking surveys of 10 river systems and gathering information on crocodiles and the monitoring of significant water bird nesting sites, and removing in excess of 190 ghost nets. As well as addressing issues in the wild river catchments, the program supports the generation of sustainable employment through an intensive mentoring model. This provides these rangers with nationally accredited training, improved confidence, leadership skills, extended networks and project management experience.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010840"></A>
There are some who claim that these are not real jobs. I reject that. These are the kinds of jobs that sit alongside very well our aspirations for Cape York. These are real jobs. These are real skills that are being provided. There are some who allege that there is no long-term commitment. This program is funded in terms of all of the outyears that any government provides in terms of long-term funding.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010842"></A>
It is about time some of the knockers actually got on board and supported programs such as this. That is why later today I will be meeting with seven of those rangers and coordinators who are visiting Brisbane to participate in the annual Premier’s public service awards. I wish them success in these awards and look forward to hearing more about their endeavours. Wild rivers rangers undertake an important role in protecting the environmental values of Cape York. Most importantly, the program is providing real jobs and real skills for young Indigenous people on the cape.</Hansard-Body>

Main Roads Accommodation, Rent Increase</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs MENKENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Main Roads. Bearing in mind the moratorium on rent increases for single pensioners, how does the minister justify a $40 a week increase in rent for a single pensioner who has been a long-term tenant in a Main Roads house in Wooloowin, leaving her just $70 a week to survive on?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010851"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I do not have those particular details with me. We have a large suite of houses across the state that we acquire for road purposes. We rent those back to tenants usually at market rates after they have been purchased. I occasionally get issues like this across the desk. The member for Brisbane Central raised a similar issue with me a couple of weeks ago. We do look at these cases individually. If someone is suffering financial stress, we will negotiate with that person and ensure that we look after that person and have a rate of return on that property that the person is comfortable with while also protecting the public asset.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the honourable minister’s interjection that the Rudd government has increased the rate of the aged pension significantly. I welcome that. That did not happen with the previous government. The Rudd government has done the right thing and increased aged pensions to assist aged pensioners. Where an aged pensioner has accommodation that they rent from my department and they are in financial stress, we will look at the individual cases and assist them where possible, as we did in the case that the member for Brisbane Central raised with me. I make no apologies for looking after the most vulnerable in this community. We will do that right across the state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010854"></A>
It is essential that we acquire these properties across the state as we roll out better roads for Queenslanders. There is a big program over the next five years--$18 billion worth of infrastructure; $18 billion worth of roads for Queenslanders. Often we are required to acquire properties to undertake that work. If the member for Burdekin wants to give me the details involving that person we will sit down, negotiate and talk to that person, as we did with the pensioner that the member for Brisbane Central raised with me. We will do that and we will do that in a humane fashion right across the state. We will continue our projects across the state--rolling out road infrastructure for the benefit of Queenslanders and often renting back properties that we acquire from people who have lived there for a number of years. But we will sit down and talk to them if they have specific difficulties.</Hansard-Body>

Mr O’BRIEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services. Last week I had the pleasure of joining the minister in officially opening the new Port Douglas Police Station. Can the minister advise the House of some of the other investments being made by the Queensland Police Service? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012705"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. It was indeed a great pleasure to join with him last week in Far North Queensland to open the new Port Douglas Police Station. It is a $3.2 million police facility right on the waterfront and it provides a fantastic facility not just for the police officers but it is also very well located for policing. I know that there were a number of issues in relation to the community during the development of that project. I thank the member for his strong advocacy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012706"></A>
 I also joined the member for Dalrymple to open the new Ravenshoe Police Station--another great facility for that community. It also contains a duplex next door for officers. That is something that the Police Service endeavours to do in terms of providing the best accommodation possible, particularly in those areas where accommodation is hard to come by. That duplex cost $667,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012707"></A>
Indeed, over the past six weeks or so I have had the pleasure of opening around seven police stations across the state, including in many electorates in Brisbane and in the Whitsunday electorate--a magnificent facility--in addition to others prior to that. In fact, this year, the government will be investing $57 million in new capital works projects across the state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012708"></A>
In addition to the very proactive capital works project, the budget provides for at least an additional 200 police officers this year--53 of those for traffic police, making a total of 106 extra traffic police over a two-year period. That is probably the biggest increase in traffic police numbers for a considerable period and, obviously, a great boost to road safety initiatives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012709"></A>
We have to contrast the Labor approach with that of the National Party. We know that the National Party went to the last election with a slash-and-burn policy--$1 billion to be cut out of the public sector, 12,000 jobs across the public sector. That would have equated to around 300 positions in the Police Service. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012710"></A>
The opposition often holds up Western Australia as a great example of what you can do, particularly with an efficiency dividend. So let us have a look at a couple of examples of what has happened in Western Australia, particularly with police. I reported in September that in that state police spending had been slashed by $27 million. What were the other consequences? A quarter of Crime Stoppers staff have been scrapped as a result of the efficiency dividend, which was supported by the National Party in Queensland as well. </Hansard-Body>

Ms JONES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. He will be aware that recently--and I think I announced it in this House--I released a discussion paper into the public arena on the protection of marine mammals such as dugongs and dolphins.

I know that this issue is a concern and it is one about which I have been having meetings with traditional owners and also with departmental officers. It was one of the drivers for me to release publicly this discussion paper and call for people to make submissions.  But I also want to make it very clear to members of the House that it is a myth--and we are talking about myths and facts today--propagated by a number of people that the major cause of dugong deaths in Queensland is from traditional owners. In actual fact, the major cause of injury and death of dugongs, as well as turtles, is from humans. It is from boat strikes.

Ms JONES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I was saying, one of the major causes of deaths to dugongs and turtles in Queensland is from boat strikes. And to reduce those deaths, this government has introduced protections through the green zones in Moreton Bay. We have expanded them from .5 per cent to 16 per cent. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MOORHEAD:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Transport. Could the minister outline to the House the average patronage figures for public transport in South-East Queensland and the average customer service figures for assistance provided by Queensland Transport customer service centres? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012747"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms NOLAN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question and I note his interest both in public transport and in customer service centres, given that we recently opened a new high-quality customer service centre in his electorate. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012748"></A>
During the last election campaign, I am sure all members will recall that the LNP promised a three per cent efficiency dividend across the whole of the Queensland Public Service. If you were to apply that three per cent dividend--as it is euphemistically called--to my department it would mean these things. Every day between 600,000 and 700,000 passengers travel by public transport in South-East Queensland. A large proportion of them, as I have previously mentioned, do it by go card. A three per cent cut in public transport would mean that over 18,000 passengers every day would not have been able to catch their daily bus, ferry or train. Every day there are 876 train services in South-East Queensland. A three per cent cut means that 26 train services would have been taken off the track. There are about 14,000 bus services. A three per cent cut means that around 420 bus services would have been taken off the busways, which, it is worth noting, the Labor government has built. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012749"></A>
The question for the opposition is: which suburbs would have missed out? In the last six months around 213,000 customers have been served at Queensland Transport service centres. A three per cent cut would have meant that over 6,300 people who were waiting in line would not have been served. Interestingly, that 6,300 number happens to be the same number of people who would be directly and indirectly employed building the Gold Coast rapid transit project, which the Leader of the Opposition is today listed on the stop light rail website as opposing. But that is, I guess, just a matter of interest. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012750"></A>
Had there been an LNP government, the jobs that could be considered to be ‘de-necessary’ include the transport inspector for auditing and compliance, which we are advertising in a number of areas, or perhaps the senior traffic officer, traffic analysis, which is a position in Brisbane that we are advertising at present. The question is this: does the opposition, which does not have a jobs target, still consider these positions to be ‘de-necessary’? The Bligh government is strengthening Queensland’s economy and ensuring jobs and job security. We are increasing services across the board when those opposite would have cut them.</Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning.

Could the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning please update the House on what is being done to secure water for South-East Queensland now and into the future?</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HINCHLIFFE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for her question. Like the people of South-East Queensland, including the members of Chermside National Seniors who are here in the public gallery today, she knows the impact of drought. South-East Queensland has endured some of the toughest water restrictions for more than three years before the worst drought on record was declared officially over when we saw those welcome relief rains in May. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014800"></A>
It is clear from recent dry spells that the risk of drought is never too far away. This is why the Bligh government is committed to providing a secure water supply for South-East Queensland, the fastest growing metropolitan region in the country. This is why the government is committed to the Traveston Crossing Dam project as part of a diverse strategy to provide a secure water supply. The Traveston Crossing Dam is the best and cheapest additional water supply option. It is the last remaining high-yield dam site in South-East Queensland and will provide enough water for around 800,000 people each day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014801"></A>
While the Bligh government is united on providing water security, it is clear that the members opposite are not. It should come as no surprise that the opposition’s Climate Proof SEQ water policy, announced in May, is not even available online anymore. The account has been suspended. I will not waste the time of the Table Office by tabling that lack of information. The members opposite have said that they would abandon plans for the Traveston Crossing Dam and instead build a desalination plant. </Hansard-Body>

Those opposite do not have any answers. It is just another opposition policy myth. They want to build a desalination plant without a water grid--a water grid they voted against. They cannot connect it up. They have previously voted against a desalination plant, water demand reduction strategies, water rebates and the Traveston Crossing Dam. With no water grid, no water reduction strategy, no water rebates and no Traveston Dam, all that remains is a disconnected desalination plant. What they are describing is desalination plants everywhere that are not connected to anything. A Traveston Crossing Dam would have filled 10 times since 2006, during South-East Queensland’s worst drought on record. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SCHWARTEN:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I will be most tolerant in my answer to the honourable member; we know her sensitivity. We have an excellent relationship with the industry in Queensland. We have an IT working group in Queensland. I am aware of the unhappiness that exists in relation to this system. This government is charged with ensuring that we spend the money that we are given by the taxpayers efficiently. To get our AAA rating back, one of the issues is to ensure we get value for taxpayers’ money. I know that it is a foreign concept to those who sit opposite. I see the member for Gympie laughing about it, but I can assure him it is not a laughing matter. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014813"></A>
The IT industry is very aware of what we are trying to do here. It is no different from other contracts with government. We are ensuring that industry is factored in to what we are doing. The bottom line is that over a long period of time a system has evolved of using contractors in the IT industry at a very high rate of pay and a very large cost to government. We are saying to the IT industry that we cannot continue down that path. We do not do it in any other industry and we should not be doing it in IT. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014814"></A>
The cornerstone of what we are establishing is a proper and mature relationship in engaging contractors in the IT industry. The IT industry in Queensland, and in the world, is quite immature when it comes down to it. I do not expect the honourable member to understand this; it is far too complicated. It is much easier to give a throwaway line on it than to sit down and work out what the economics of this is all about.</Hansard-Body>

 The honourable member never takes an interjection when she is on her feet. When I respond to her she takes offence and pleads that I am doing all sorts of things. I would seek your guidance on it, Mr Speaker. It is most difficult. She never takes an interjection herself, but she refuses to allow me to answer the question with her persistent, inane, immature and childish interjections while I am trying to give a sensible answer to this question. The reality is that the system that we are enacting is one--</Hansard-Body>

 Mr Speaker, please. I cannot respond to this member because she accuses me of threatening her. It would be better if she did not interject so that I can actually answer the question.

 As a general ruling--and I have been asked for that by the minister--I would say this: anybody who interjects does so at their own peril. I have said that repeatedly.

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms PALASZCZUK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Mulgrave for his question. As we are all aware, every year about 350 children are diagnosed with autism and we know that autism has an impact on children’s social interaction, communication and capacity for imaginative thinking. However, we know that if we can get in early and help these children it is going to benefit them in the long run. That is why early intervention is very important.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1020990"></A>
I was very pleased last week to actually visit the electorate of the member for Mulgrave and go to the Edmonton centre for autism. The Bligh government has committed $170,000 to this centre and, through the advocacy of the member for Mulgrave, we are now able to commit a further $46,000, which means that this centre will be completed on time by the end of the year. This is great news for Cairns. It also means that we will be able to outreach up into the cape and we will be able to double the capacity at this centre from 32 children to 64 children. This is great news for Far North Queensland. It means that we are getting on with the job of delivering for children with a disability.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr FOLEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maryborough--Ind) (11.31 am): I rise to participate briefly in the cognate debate today. Most members in this House would be aware of the ill effects of smoking, especially where smoking takes place around children. For the life of me I cannot understand how any parent could drive down the road with a car full of kids while smoking cigarettes. Smoking in cars is an absolute no-no. We have introduced far-reaching legislation that talks about where people can and cannot smoke that is designed to keep clouds of smoke away from people who do not wish to smell like a chimney. I for one have been critical of some of these rules. I believe that what we have done in shopping centres is to create small smoking ghettos far too close to the entrances so that the smoke drifts in anyway. I am in favour of moving those smoking areas further away. In my own electorate I find groups of kids--all smoking--hanging around very close to the entrance. They congregate together and their behaviour can be interpreted as threatening.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021004"></A>
Obviously it is a no-brainer to put in place legislation that outlaws smoking in cars that contain kids. Dropping ash is a fire hazard if people wear nylon clothing. However, more than that, effectively entrapping children in a car full of smoke and undertaking, say, a four-hour drive is obviously going to be rather detrimental to their health.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021005"></A>
Cutting red tape to allow professionals to work anywhere in Australia without requiring additional registration is a great idea as long as the process of vetting them in the first place is entirely thorough. If someone slips through the net vis-à-vis a Dr Patel--we have had many cases in Queensland where doctors of dubious skill level--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021006"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Mr Wendt): Order! There is an issue in relation to that matter which is before the courts. I ask you to be very careful what you say.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021007"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Sorry about that. There have been a number of high-profile cases involving medical practitioners who are less than skilled for the jobs that they are undertaking. Heaven knows we need a regime with national transference. My point is this: the difficulty is that, if a person slips through the net in one state and then has an as-of-right registration in all other states, they have effectively been given carte blanche to move out of one area with less than desirable practising skills and move to another area where everyone would think they are fine because they have been checked out and have been given national accreditation. So long as that national accreditation is entirely robust, that provision is probably a good idea.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021009"></A>
Cutting red tape is certainly a great idea. In my own area they have been able to source GPs. However, because the feds have not recognised it as an area of special need, they basically sit around twiddling their thumbs for months on end, unable to work or feed their families and the medical practices cannot afford to keep them on staff. We have had a number of cases like that in our public health system on the Fraser Coast as well.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021010"></A>
Mandatory reporting of professional misconduct across all professions is a noble and worthwhile cause, although I would also sound some warning bells here. We do not want to see a culture of getting back or of dobbing. Every single member of this House would have had experience of people who make salacious complaints on very minor grounds. That can make the life of a health practitioner or any other person absolutely unbearable. This is a real problem. Let me give an example. Let us just say a doctor, or a nurse for that matter, has experienced a tragedy in their family and they are suffering from depression as a result, which is entirely treatable with modern drugs that are nonaddictive by nature, and they seek treatment for it. If I was a doctor, I would be very wary about to whom I went or to whom I disclosed any particular medical problems for fear that that doctor says, ‘In my opinion that person is unsuitable to practise.’ It does not matter whether they are or are not fit to practise; it is almost a regime where a person is guilty until proven innocent.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021011"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Lucas:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 And what if they did and they injured a patient?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021012"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That comes back to what I said before that as long as the process of selection in the first instance is entirely robust and they have that national accreditation. Let me clarify this. If there is any hint of professional misconduct, sexual impropriety or bad medical practices, I would 100 per cent support that provision. But taking a broadbrush approach whereby any person for any particular reason could be named and shamed without any proof can cause a great deal of distress. If that doctor is already suffering from depression and all of a sudden someone decides to be even more injurious in their application, that could spiral them significantly further downhill rather than helping them in their recovery. We all recognise that, because of the pressure that medical professionals work under, especially in the state system, they will succumb to all manner of health conditions that in someone’s opinion might make them unsuitable to work. We need to be very careful that that situation does not turn into a witch-hunt or a ‘get back quick’. As I said, the mandatory reporting of all of the other issues of sexual misconduct or inappropriate treatment is an absolute no-brainer. We have seen many instances of injury caused to patients and we could not come down too harshly with regard to that particular area.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021015"></A>
The national scheme commencing on 1 July 2010 recognises 10 health professions. It is almost easier to say which ones are not covered by the list, because these days there are so many other categories such as music therapists. I notice there are an additional four professions included which are medical radiation, occupational therapists and also Chinese medicine practitioners, and I would ask the minister for a clarification: does that include acupuncture, or is it more herbal medicine?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021044"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Lucas:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 I will check that, but part of it is having a degree of control under Chinese medicine as well to make sure that they are appropriately qualified people and not people who claim to be that.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Okay. I note that there are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health practitioners. I am not aware of what they are. I would like to at some stage be informed of that as well. Dental technicians and speech pathologists are currently registered in Queensland and have not yet been included in the national scheme but will continue to be registered on a state by state basis. I think this idea of registration and vetting is an excellent idea. I think it needs to be across all of the medical disciplines. My wife is a medical laboratory scientist, a pathology scientist, with some 30 years experience. That profession does not seem to be in that list. Also, there are a number of other professions like music therapists. Maybe a better way to go would be to look at the registration of all parahealth professionals and then weed out the ones that are not suitable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021050"></A>
The overall bill is a step in the right direction. As I said, there are only just those couple of things that do alarm me. As members we have all seen the ongoing usage of bodies like the CMC and so forth for complaints. It is the same in other portfolios. Every policeman has had complaints made against them because someone did not like getting a traffic ticket. We do not want to see a regime like that. </Hansard-Body>

That the bill be now read a second time.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021065"></A>
The bill seeks to disrupt and restrict the activities of criminal organisations and their members and associates. Members of outlaw motorcycle gangs and other criminal organisations have been involved in activities such as attempted murder, extortion, drug manufacturing and distribution and pose a threat to Queensland. In response to outlaw motorcycle gang violence in southern states, other states and territories around Australia have passed legislation aimed at disrupting the activities of criminal organisations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021066"></A>
The extraordinary powers provided for in this bill are necessary to send a clear message that Queensland will not be seen to be or to have become a safe haven for criminal organisations who may be tempted to move their operations from other states and territories. In developing this bill it should be noted, however, that we have adopted a cautious approach in light of the experience in other jurisdictions, insisting on the inclusion of a range of safeguards to ensure an appropriate balance is achieved.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021067"></A>
It should be noted that the Queensland Police Service already possesses extensive powers to attack crime, including those powers set out in the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000. The powers set out in this bill will augment, but not replace, those existing powers to combat serious organised criminal activity in Queensland. It is anticipated that the powers provided in this act will be used in the most serious cases as a further extraordinary tool in the law enforcement armoury. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021068"></A>
The structure and methods of organised crime pose a challenge to the traditional processes of the criminal justice system which are designed to prosecute and punish proven criminal activity committed by individuals. The long-term disruption of ongoing criminal enterprises may require more than isolated prosecutions of individual members. Furthermore, successful prosecutions of members of organised criminal groups have previously been hindered by intimidation and violence towards witnesses and investigators. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021069"></A>
The bill provides an additional method for combating organised criminal activity. First, the bill creates a mechanism for the Police Commissioner to make a civil application to the Supreme Court to obtain a declaration that an organisation is a ‘criminal organisation’--namely, one whose members associate for the purpose of engaging in or conspiring to engage in serious criminal activity, and where the organisation is an unacceptable risk to the safety, welfare or order of the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021070"></A>
The Supreme Court declaration forms the basis on which the Police Commissioner can apply to the supreme court to obtain further civil orders, including orders against the organisation itself, members of the criminal organisation and associates of the criminal organisation. Once the declaration is in place the Police Commissioner can make civil applications to the Supreme Court for control orders against individuals. A declaration that an organisation is a criminal organisation may also assist in making public safety orders and fortification removal orders. The civil standard of proof applies to all of these applications. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021071"></A>
A control order can prohibit a member of a declared organisation from engaging in certain behaviours which may facilitate serious criminal behaviour--for example, obtaining a weapons licence, obtaining employment in the gaming or liquor industry, associating with other members and associates of criminal organisations or recruiting new members into criminal organisations. The bill creates an offence of contravening a control order which carries a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment for a first offence and five years imprisonment for any subsequent offence.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021072"></A>
A public safety order can prohibit an individual or group of persons from entering a premises, specified area or attending an event. The Supreme Court can make a public safety order if satisfied that the presence of the individual or group at a premises or area or event poses a serious risk to public safety or security and may be made for any period it considers necessary but no longer than six months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021073"></A>
In urgent circumstances, a public safety order made without notice to an individual or group of persons can only remain in force for a period of 24 hours unless the court directs otherwise. This will enable the commissioner to respond to serious threats to public safety or security even in circumstances where that threat emerges suddenly and outside of court business hours. An offence of contravening a public safety order is created under the act. The offence carries a maximum penalty of one year imprisonment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021074"></A>
Fortification removal orders can be sought by police from the Supreme Court to require an individual or organisation to modify or remove fortifications from particular premises. Fortifications pose a significant obstacle in the execution of search warrants on criminal organisations. The bill creates an offence of hindering the removal or modification of a fortification. The offence carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021075"></A>
A central feature of the scheme provided for in the bill is the use of criminal intelligence. In all civil applications under this bill, the commissioner may apply to the Supreme Court to have certain evidence declared to be criminal intelligence. Once the Supreme Court has declared the evidence to be criminal intelligence, it cannot be disclosed to any person including the respondent to an application or their legal representatives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021076"></A>
In order for the evidence to be declared criminal intelligence, the Police Commissioner must satisfy the Supreme Court that the evidence would prejudice criminal investigations, identify a confidential source of information, or endanger the safety of another person. This allows the court to hear important evidence against individuals, organisations and groups whilst maintaining the physical safety of informants and covert operatives and minimising the threat of prejudicing a criminal investigation. The bill creates an offence of unlawful disclosure of criminal intelligence which carries a maximum penalty of one year imprisonment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021077"></A>
The bill includes significant safeguards which provide a balance between any abrogation of democratic principles and procedural fairness and ensuring that the bill is effective in achieving its objectives whilst protecting the personal security and safety of covert police officers. At the core of the safeguards is the role of the Supreme Court in hearing and determining all applications. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021078"></A>
Further, a Criminal Organisation Public Interest Monitor will monitor and report on all applications under the act involving criminal intelligence. Annual legislative reviews will be undertaken by the Criminal Organisation Public Interest Monitor and a retired judicial officer. The parliamentary Law, Justice and Safety Committee will monitor the role and review the performance of the Criminal Organisation Public Interest Monitor, will report to the Legislative Assembly on any matter about the COPIM, and will examine each of the annual reports tabled in the Legislative Assembly. The bill also contains a seven-year sunset clause. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021080"></A>
The bill creates the roles and functions of the Criminal Organisation Public Interest Monitor, which is akin to the role of an amicus curiae or friend of the court. The COPIM will carry out a similar function to that undertaken by the current Public Interest Monitor for controlled operation and telecommunication interception warrants.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021081"></A>
The involvement of the COPIM was considered essential given that one of the centrepieces of the new regime is the use of ‘criminal intelligence’ which is presented to a court in the absence of the respondent. The COPIM will be present at all hearings under the bill to assist the court in testing the appropriateness and validity of applications. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021113"></A>
The bill provides for annual reports to be completed by both the COPIM and a retired Supreme Court judge. The bill provides for both reports to be tabled in the Legislative Assembly. As noted previously, the bill provides for this legislation to be reviewed by a retired Supreme Court judge five years after its commencement to determine whether it is operating effectively and meeting its objectives, and the bill also provides for a report of this review to be tabled in the Legislative Assembly. </Hansard-Body>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021116"></A>
The bill also amends a number of acts. A number of offences in the Criminal Code are amended by the insertion of new circumstances of aggravation. For example, the maximum penalty of seven years for the offence of retaliation against a judicial officer, juror or witness will increase to 10 years if the act is done in relation to a proceeding before a court under the proposed legislation. The amendments are necessary to deter tactics of intimidation and violence towards potential witnesses and law enforcement investigators. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021117"></A>
In order to ensure the physical safety of criminal organisation informants, the bill amends the Criminal Code by the insertion of a new offence of obtaining or disclosing secret information about an informant’s identity. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021118"></A>
The objects of the bill provide that the parliament does not intend that the powers under the legislation will be exercised in a way that diminishes the freedom of persons to participate in advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action. Organisations involved in serious criminal activity pose a threat to Queensland and challenge the criminal justice system, which is generally designed to prosecute and punish isolated crimes committed by individuals.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021119"></A>
This bill provides an alternative method in combating organised criminal activity and will ensure Queensland does not become a safe haven for criminal organisations. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr McLINDON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Beaudesert--LNP) (11.51 am): I rise to speak to the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill 2009, which are being treated as cognate bills. The bill proposes a number of changes which can be seen in the amendments to the various acts. This legislation brings in mandatory misconduct provisions. As the minister stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021129"></A>
The new provisions differ from the lapsed bill and will allow Queensland’s new mandatory reporting requirements to be transitioned to the new national scheme once it is introduced. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021131"></A>
In effect, there will be a national scheme. However, the Medical Board of Queensland will be made responsible for the enforcement of this misconduct reporting process as the administrator. The minister stated--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021133"></A>
The Board will undertake a communication campaign to inform the medical profession of the new obligation ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021134"></A>
It would be wise if the minister and his department considered the feedback from health professionals before they undertook that campaign. I suggest that, alongside the campaigns to make people aware of their obligations, the government includes its own key responsibility to address the system flaws still inherent in the reporting processes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021135"></A>
Clinicians can only work within the system they have, and the government cannot solely rely on crudely forcing clinicians to make these subjective judgements and then report. This will not solve the problem because it is not a silver bullet. We must remember the amount of surgical and clinical audits that clinicians already undertake to monitor patient care. At what point are we actually impeding a clinician from what they are there to do--that is, treat the patients and improve their quality of life?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021136"></A>
I suggest the government goes back and looks at the current processes and refine them and look at addressing screening and reporting problems to make the system work more effectively in the first principle, rather than engage in the consequences of more duplication. Duplication is the last thing Queensland’s health system needs. The government cannot entertain information awareness campaigns until it is aware of all the issues involved itself. Simply making doctors report inadequacies within the system without further investigation or follow-up is not a true way forward. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021137"></A>
In its submission to the Senate Community Affairs Committee on the exposure draft of the health practitioner regulation national law in July, the AMA said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021139"></A>
The definition of reportable conduct requires further consultation with the health professions. In effect, the relevant provisions in the draft Bill represent new mandatory reporting requirements across the health professions, as well as for the medical profession who are subject to existing state/territory laws. The draft definition in the Bill has a very broad application and there are considerable risks that health professionals will over-report, or not know when to report. We support suggestions by other health profession groups for educative scenarios to be provided to registrants so they have some certainty of what would be considered in scope as reportable conduct, before case law is established.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021140"></A>
The medical defence organisations will provide full and detailed submissions on the mandatory reporting requirements and we ask that these submissions be given full and careful consideration. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021141"></A>
Spouses, treating doctors and other professionals ... such as the doctors’ advisory health service, should be included in the exemptions to the mandatory reporting requirements in clause 156.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021142"></A>
Further, the draft Bill should expressly preclude medical practitioners who participate in quality assurance activities in accordance with the Commonwealth Health Insurance Act 1973 from any requirement to report reportable conduct identified during those activities. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021143"></A>
The government must ensure that these considerations have been taken into account. The government must remember that it, too, has a responsibility with its own reporting systems. I recently wrote to the Auditor-General on what is a clear contrast between the data coming out of the government’s health reports and the reality experienced by patients in the Beaudesert region. I know that the shadow health minister, Mark McArdle, has exposed the widespread instances of fraudulent approaches to reporting ED outcomes and has proposed measures for a universal, open and accountable reporting framework that better reflects the emergency departments and also the patients’ experiences in those departments. And of course we have heard from the Auditor-General’s report, which outlined the following: the lack of transparent links between the state and district service plans, no clear prioritisation of district needs, no clear link between service plans and funding allocation, and no monitoring, evaluation or reporting framework in place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021145"></A>
A recommendation of the Australian Council on Healthcare Standards suggests incidents like access block be reported by health services as part of key performance indicators for resources, and I suggest the government thinks long and hard about how the KPIs are employed in the Queensland health system. To place an unhealthy amount of emphasis on directors coming under budget is resulting in this government directly encouraging corners to be cut, and there is far too much emphasis placed on that. Studies in 2008 drew attention to the fact that there must be a direct nexus between financial accountability and clinical care to ensure clinical outcomes of financial decisions are clear and apparent.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021146"></A>
The government should not simply demand medical directors come under a financial threshold by whatever means necessary and reward them through that mechanism. This is lazy policy and it is detrimental policy. It would pay the government to heed the words of Nobel recipient Lord Rutherford, who said in his laboratory to his colleagues, ‘We haven’t got the money so we’ve got to think.’ The government should not place unacceptable burdens on medical directors simply through budgetary KPIs but should actually divert that energy to refining health service reporting processes in a positive way whilst ensuring efficient front-line services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021148"></A>
There can be no other objective but setting and maintaining high standards of patient service and care, and this must remain the priority. It is important that the community has confidence not only in their doctors but also in the system that sets the foundation for this care. On this point, I cautiously welcome the increased responsibility of nurse practitioners. I am cautious and can only be suspicious of this, given the government’s record for subcontracting certain responsibilities in health care. As stated, nurse practitioners will often be the first point of contact for patients with work related injuries who present at primary healthcare facilities and emergency departments for initial diagnosis and treatment. However, I caution against even entertaining the idea of going down the road of diluting the role of a nurse and nurse practitioners to that of a bureaucrat on the one hand and lumping more responsibility on them with the other.</Hansard-Body>

Mr McLINDON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 However, I caution against even entertaining the idea of going down the road of diluting the role of a nurse and nurse practitioners to that of a bureaucrat on the one hand and lumping more responsibility on them with the other. That is a recipe for disaster. I caution against the government simply turning existing nurses into nurse practitioners. This is not good policy because that simply results in fewer nurses. So I would suggest the government have a comprehensive strategy for dealing with this very complex issue. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr KNUTH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Dalrymple--LNP) (11.57 am): The Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is designed to amend a number of acts. It is imperative that we support any attempt to improve protection for patients and ensure Queenslanders receive the best possible health care. For too long, the underfunding of Queensland Health and the increasing levels of introduced bureaucracy have resulted in conditions where patient care has been compromised. While the LNP is supportive of the intent of the legislation, there are several amendments that we will move to ensure that confidence in doctors by all patients, including their colleagues, is not threatened by any requirement to break a patient’s confidentiality. While we do not want to see impaired doctors putting the safety and wellbeing of patients at risk, we do not want to see doctors avoid their own health problems for fear of being reported. We need to return to the absolute faith we previously had in the profession and trust that a doctor will not knowingly risk the life of a patient, not give one of his colleagues the ultimate responsibility to report. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021155"></A>
Under the bill, it will be an offence for a person to smoke in a vehicle if someone under the age of 16 is present in the vehicle. This part protects the health and wellbeing of our minors. Making it illegal to smoke in a vehicle used for business purposes when another person is present is over the top. Adults are legally able to make their own choice and suffer the consequences. We are becoming a nanny state by eroding the rights of our citizens. Most companies have their own smoking policy which determines where and when employees can smoke. Most companies ban smoking in vehicles anyway. Why does the government have to add its draconian attempts to control the equation? Do our police officers have that much time on their hands that they can afford to police another ridiculous piece of legislation and determine whether the car is being used for business purposes, issue fines accordingly, and then spend hours completing the ridiculous amount of paperwork required? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021194"></A>
Other amendments include provisions to allow nurse practitioners to issue medical certificates for minor injuries. This makes sense. Our doctors, especially in communities dominated by highly regulated industries such as the mining industry, are overwhelmed with requests for medical certificates. This will alleviate some of the pressure from the doctors and allow them to deal with sick patients and not satisfy the requirements of overregulated industries. In the case of Forsayth, years ago nurses were able to dispense medication that had been prescribed by doctors because of the unavailability of doctors and pharmacists in the area. This provision was outlawed, and we had a terribly frustrating and dangerous time during massive flooding when patients ran out of their medication and had no local avenue to provide it when the floods remained for three weeks. These changes will hopefully lead to greater recognition of the effort and professionalism of the health workers working in rural and remote areas where there is no available doctor.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1021199"></A>
The Health Practitioner Regulated National Law Bill 2009 will hopefully also lead to more equitable outcomes for those rural practices that rely on the work of locums. The right to private practice is one small incentive to encourage general practitioners to work in rural communities. Recently we had a ridiculous situation where a busy rural practice with the right to private practice had to wait until a provider number was provided. His public provider number was fast-tracked, which allowed the locum to see patients in an adjoining hospital, but he could not work in the practice without a number. All the paperwork was lodged within appropriate time limits, and the public provider number was fast-tracked. The private one, however, was not. Without this, he was unable to refer patients for X-rays and specialist appointments, and patients were unable to receive the Medicare rebate. Every time a locum changes location he requires a new provider number. This is bureaucratic overkill--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021203"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr KNUTH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This is bureaucratic overkill and is completely unsustainable in rural communities where it is difficult to attract permanent doctors and where we rely on services from local doctors. While I acknowledge the announcement by the member for Mulgrave to make provision to call for tenders for a CT scanner for the Atherton Tablelands, and I appreciate the minister looking into an issue I raised in parliament in a question to him about six to eight weeks ago, I want to say that that CT scanner was pushed for more than five years ago and was promised in May this year. It is very important for the tablelands people as we have a thousand patients going up to Cairns. We have medical practitioners who have been threatening to resign if the scanner is not provided. Some of those medical surgeons will leave. They are in the process of leaving, and I encourage the minister to give us all the support we can get in looking for provisions for other medical surgeons to take over those surgeons’ places.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021207"></A>
We need a CT scanner for the Atherton Tablelands. As I say, a thousand per year are going to Cairns to get access to these scanners. This is also putting pressure on the Cairns Base Hospital surgery. That would relieve that pressure off the Cairns Base Hospital and allow those people to stay in the Tablelands, which is very important and important for the health system in the Cairns Base Hospital.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021212"></A>
The previous health minister knows that we have been pushing for a dementia unit based at the Eventide Aged Care Facility. It is a wonderful facility which was built in 1929. It is the biggest issue going besides this CT scanner. It is probably the most passionate issue that I have confronted. In an area with more than 13,000 people they are having to send their loved ones who have dementia on 1,000-kilometre round trips. We have 80-year-old ladies who see their loved ones being sent 1,000 kilometres away when we have this wonderful facility. We have a ward there--Pandanus--which is closed. It is sitting there laying idle--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr EMERSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Indooroopilly--LNP) (12.04 pm): I rise today to contribute to the cognate debate on the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill and the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill. The Queensland health system has been in a dire state under this government. It has been characterised by neglect, mismanagement, a lack of forethought and inappropriate responses to crisis. The minister even publicly admits he cannot control soaring hospital waiting lists. This begs the question: is there anything the minister can control? These bills are another example of this government falling short of expectations. These bills do introduce some good initiatives, but in some areas the bills go too far and in others not far enough. That is despite feedback from the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021219"></A>
The opposition will be moving some crucial amendments to these bills. The first of these proposes four necessary exceptions to the harsh mandatory reporting provisions. The second amendment we will be proposing will extend the ban on smoking in business vehicles to private vehicles as well. This will make these laws more easily enforced and further protect the health of Queenslanders.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021221"></A>
The health amendment bill amends the Medical Practitioners Registration Act 2001, the Health Practitioners (Professional Standards) Act 1999 and introduces a system of mandatory reporting of professional misconduct by doctors. This system of mandatory reporting is also a feature of the health practitioners bill. It is good to see the government finally trying to improve protection for patients and ensure Queenslanders receive the best possible care.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021224"></A>
Mandatory reporting will increase protection of the public by enhancing the Medical Board’s ability to identify instances of serious misconduct for doctors. However, it still exhibits major flaws. Mandatory reporting legislation is already in operation in New South Wales as of late last year. In a short time the industry has already heard of instances where practitioners have raised concerns about discussing matters with other medical professionals due to fear of being expelled. AMA Queensland has argued that sick doctors would be driven underground, putting patients’ lives at risk. AMAQ President, Dr Mason Stevenson, has said that the bill removes a fundamental right of medical confidentiality and that it should not extend to doctors treating doctors.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021226"></A>
It is concerning that doctors will be required to report doctors seeking medical treatment. It could lead to doctors not seeking medical assistance at an early stage due to a fear of being reported. That could mean that sick doctors will continue to work without telling anyone, putting patients’ lives at risk. These fears are shared by the AMAQ, the AMA, the Medical Board and the Doctors Health Advisory Service. Some of these concerns about mandatory reporting can be allayed by supporting the amendment the opposition will be moving to the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. This amendment will remove the requirement for registrants to give notice about reportable misconduct in four particular circumstances where it is undesirable to require them to do so. The first of these is where the first registrant is a spouse of the second registrant. This amendment will protect the marriage relationship. Spouses would, however, still be required to report the misconduct in instances of sexual misconduct. Other proposed exemptions to the mandatory reporting requirement include where the conduct has or is likely to have already been reported, where the first registrant becomes aware of the misconduct as a result of a protected confidence or while providing a professional service to the registrant.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021230"></A>
The Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill amends the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 to ban smoking in cars with children under the age of 16. The opposition has been calling for this kind of measure for a number of years. It is good to see Labor finally supporting such a measure to save the lives of Queenslanders. This measure may be perceived as an intrusion into an individual’s private domain. It is similar to the prohibition of mobile phone use while driving. While enforcement in both cases has and would prove to be challenging, they are necessary measures for the public interest. Smoking in cars carrying children is currently banned in three states--South Australia, Tasmania and New South Wales. In Tasmania the age is 18. In New South Wales it is 16, which leads to the consistency of enforcement argument given the Coolangatta region shares a border with New South Wales.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021262"></A>
In South Australia the ban commenced in 2007 and 110 people were booked within the first year. The penalty was $75. Under the proposed legislation, a maximum penalty of 20 penalty units, which represents a sum of $2,000, would apply. It has been proposed that police will enforce the ban by issuing $200 on-the-spot fines to those contravening the ban. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021265"></A>
There is strong community support for banning smoking in cars carrying children. In October 2007 Queensland Health released a discussion paper on Queensland’s smoking legislation. Of the 588 submissions received from the general public, 89 per cent called for a ban on smoking in cars carrying children. This measure is consistent with the current legislation prohibiting smoking in enclosed spaces such as boats, trains and aircraft. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021267"></A>
The minister told us in his second reading speech that each year more than 3,400 Queenslanders die from smoking, and passive smoking is an enormous part of this risk. In Queensland smoking related hospital admissions cost more than $217 million every year. The burden is unsustainable. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021268"></A>
In general, the prevalence of people who smoke is reducing, particularly those who smoke in their cars. Some 87 per cent of car owners surveyed in 2005 reported that smoking does not occur in their car. Of smokers, only 31 per cent with children below 14 years of age reported they still smoke in their cars. In Queensland there are still 276,000 smokers with children under 16 years of age in their household. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021269"></A>
Environmental tobacco smoke is a complex mixture of chemicals, containing over 4,000 chemical compounds including 60 known cancer causing chemicals. In children the risk from exposure to passive smoking includes bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma, ear infections and sudden infant death syndrome. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021271"></A>
Proposed new section 26VC provides that a person must not smoke in a motor vehicle if the vehicle is on a road or road related areas and another person in the vehicle is under 16 years of age. The dangers of smoking are present in all vehicles to people of all ages. That is why the opposition will be moving an amendment to extend the restriction on smoking in a vehicle when others are present to include private vehicles as well as business vehicles and regardless of age. Many people use the same vehicle for both business and private purposes. This amendment will also assist in enforcement by police. There is no longer a need to determine whether a vehicle is for private or business use before investigating further as to the age of the occupants of the vehicle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021272"></A>
The Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill further protects Queenslanders from the danger of smoking by amending the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 and the Tobacco and Other Smoking Products Act 1998. The proposed amendments restrict the use of smoking related products for tobacco advertising and allow local governments to regulate smoking at public transport waiting points and pedestrian malls. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021275"></A>
Again, the Queensland Health review demonstrated a level of community support for these measures. Some 78 per cent of people supported banning smoking in pedestrian malls. Some 81 per cent supported banning smoking at public transport waiting points. These measures further reduce Queensland’s exposure to smoking by allowing local government to prohibit it in areas where people are involuntarily crowded. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021276"></A>
In conclusion, I urge the government to support the opposition’s amendment. These bills bring in so many good, strong measures to repair the long-damaged Queensland health system and generally improve the health of Queenslanders. I hope the government will soften its approach and see that these amendments make sense otherwise the other good initiatives proposed will come undone. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms van LITSENBURG</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Redcliffe--ALP) (12.12 pm): I rise to support the health bills that are being debated cognately. These bills amend, among other things, a number of acts to ensure better health outcomes for Queenslanders. In these times of unprecedented population growth, an increasingly ageing population and an explosion in chronic disease across the state, the nation and the world it is vital that governments look at all the ways they can ensure the optimum levels of good health in our community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021279"></A>
The Bligh government is a responsible government that puts the health of Queenslanders first. Extending the protection of non-smoking areas, particularly for young people, to outdoor public areas such as within 10 metres of playgrounds, within the patrolled and flagged areas on beaches, in front of all public buildings, indoor and outdoor eating places and large outdoor events, public buildings, major sport stadiums and in all vehicles where young children are present will provide a healthier environment for everyone in a wider variety of social situations in their lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021281"></A>
It also provides a strong example for young people that smoking is not a social activity. These provisions will increase the enjoyment of public events for the vast majority of the population who will not be disturbed by smoke in confined outdoor areas such as at concerts or sports events where they cannot easily move away. That means that they will be less likely to be passively smoking and in danger of lung and other health issues later in life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021282"></A>
The bill also empowers local governments to enforce new measures in open air shopping malls and public transport waiting areas. The bill also ensures that smoking related products or brands can no longer be advertised ensuring that young people are not getting the suggestion that certain smoking related brands or indeed the act of smoking itself is cool. These provisions are about preventing the onset of health issues later in life meaning fewer people go over the cliff and instead are redirected to safer paths and thus healthier lifestyles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021283"></A>
The amendments to the health practitioner registration boards institute strong, mandatory reporting measures ensuring that patients get the best outcomes. In fact, medical practitioners who become aware of or reasonably suspect reportable misconduct may face disciplinary action under the Health Practitioners (Professional Standards) Act. Health professionals are bound by a strict duty of confidentiality under the Health Services Act but this bill adds three exceptions to allow necessary disclosure in specific circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021286"></A>
The first is an exception when the safety of a child is involved such as when a doctor suspects abuse due to the type of injuries a child is admitted with. These new disclosures are not about informing the department of child safety or the police as these provisions are already within the act but informing people who are willing and able to keep the child safe such as a family member. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021287"></A>
The second exception will mean the director-general of Queensland Health can disclose patient information to lawyers representing a patient. The third exception is to ensure the safety of the community in controlling illness and to provide treatment for the sick. Each of those exceptions will provide a greater degree of protection for the patient involved and the community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021288"></A>
Another amendment in this bill that will improve outcomes for patients is the one that allows nurse practitioners to sign workers compensation certificates so people with work related injuries, who have been treated by a nurse practitioner in an emergency department, do not have to wait until a doctor can examine them and sign their workers compensation certificate. This means shorter stays in the ED and a better use of medical resources. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021289"></A>
This Labor government is working hard to produce the best health system in the country and we are succeeding. Our health system has never been better and it is continuing to improve. The Redcliffe Hospital in my electorate has had huge upgrades in the last three years, not the least of which are the new specialist, allied health and emergency departments. The hospital had the first nurse practitioners working in ED departments. It is a best practice program that has made waiting times for category 4 and 5 patients much shorter. There will also be a children’s ED in the near future. In the last 18 months the government has upgrade the number of doctors and nurses in the hospital as it has done right across the state. The people of Redcliffe are proud of their hospital and the many proactive lifestyle programs it offers them. The amendments in this bill will increase the day-to-day efficiencies of our health system and will go a long way towards safeguarding the health of many Queenslanders so that they will have healthier lives and will not need to use hospital services as often in their lives. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021290"></A>
I commend the minister for the amendments in this bill that will go a long way to preventing many lifestyle illnesses and will ensure many children can grow up safely. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Ms FARMER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Bulimba--ALP) (12.19 pm): I rise to lend my support to the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill and the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill. I would like to speak mainly to the amendments that the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill make to protect the health of our children and the wider community from the dangers of smoking. This bill contains an important amendment that will ban smoking in cars with children to protect the health of young children and babies. In Queensland, there are 276,000 smokers with children under 16 years of age in the household. The levels of tobacco smoke in a vehicle are very high. Young children involuntarily exposed to tobacco smoke in a very confined environment, such as a car, have significantly increased health risks including bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma, ear infections and sudden infant death syndrome. This ban is about setting a community standard of not smoking around children. As a parent of a young child myself, I am delighted to support it.</Hansard-Body>

Comprehensive smoke-free laws are already helping to the protect children from exposure to tobacco smoke in public places. Queensland’s tobacco laws protect young people, with bans on smoking within 10 metres of children’s playgrounds; between the flags at patrolled beaches; in all public buildings; indoors and outdoors at all restaurants, cafes and eating places; at large outdoor events; within four metres of almost all building entrances; at major sports stadiums; and, with this amendment, in all vehicles where children are present. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021319"></A>
The definition of ‘motor vehicle’ used in the bill captures any vehicle that is propelled by a motor that forms part of the vehicle. These amendments will also apply regardless of how many passengers may be seated in the vehicle. Examples include passenger cars, including convertibles or those with a sunroof, trucks, buses and utilities. The offence of smoking in a motor vehicle will not apply to an aircraft, boat or train. These types of vehicles or vessels are included as an enclosed place under part 2B of the Tobacco and Other Smoking Products Act. Therefore, smoking is prohibited within these types of vehicles. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021321"></A>
The offence of smoking in a motor vehicle with a child present will apply on public roads including a busway, a toll road, a bridge, railway crossings, a tunnel, a dividing strip, a shoulder including a kerb or unsealed side of the road, and a footpath or nature strip adjacent to a road. The offence will also apply to a vehicle parked or moving in a public car park, including in a shopping centre car park. It was necessary to include in the legislation road related areas to deter drivers or smokers from pulling over and smoking in the car while it was parked before resuming their travel. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021322"></A>
The statutory minimum age of criminal responsibility is 10 years. Therefore, any person over the age of 10 years is able to be issued with a fine for committing this offence. However, it is not intended to target young people for this offence. The purpose of this legislation is to reduce the exposure of young children to environmental tobacco smoke. The legislation aims to prevent or reduce the number of parents and carers, or older friends and siblings, who are smoking in motor vehicles with children present. The amendments create a defence for a person issued with a fine for this offence if the person can prove at the time of the offence that the person honestly and reasonably believed that no person in the vehicle was under 16 years of age. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021323"></A>
These amendments will also enable the passengers of motors vehicles to be asked for their age or date of birth to assist police in determining whether a person is aged under 16 years. In cases where a person’s age is evident, for example a young child, it will not be necessary for a police officer to ask the child for his or her age or date of birth. All police officers have discretion regarding what action, if any, is to be taken in regard to any situation. Therefore, police will have discretion not to issue an on-the-spot fine for this offence. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021324"></A>
This bill also contains important amendments to prevent smoking in pedestrian malls and at public transport waiting points. Queensland is setting a world standard in smoke-free laws for outdoor places. Although smoke-free laws for indoor places are most effective in protecting people from environmental tobacco smoke, smoke-free laws for outdoor public places are about going further and influencing social norms. In short, the laws are about supporting social change and creating an environment where nonsmoking is the norm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021325"></A>
In Queensland, smoke-free laws are moving smokers away from crowded areas, such as building entrances, and disconnecting the acts of eating and drinking from the act of smoking by ensuring that all outdoor eating or drinking places are smoke free. Queenslanders are enjoying the benefits of our many smoke-free places and calls for laws to go further are a reflection of this change. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021326"></A>
Many members of the public, through letters and submissions as well as health groups, have expressed concern about exposure to tobacco smoke in crowded public places, specifically pedestrian malls and public transport waiting points, for example bus stops, taxi ranks and ferry wharves. Transferring the power to local government to regulate smoking in problem areas, including pedestrian malls and public transport waiting areas, means that concerns about exposure to tobacco smoke in crowded areas can be targeted specifically at a local level. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021327"></A>
There are public spaces throughout the state that are shared by smokers and nonsmokers, but every city and town is different. The most practical approach to enforcement is for local government to be empowered to appropriately apply further outdoor smoking restrictions where required. The amendments in this bill will empower local governments to make new local laws to ban smoking. Individual local governments are best placed to determine in which areas smoking restrictions are required. This amendment will allow for local considerations and local solutions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021329"></A>
These amendments support Queensland Health’s Health Action Plan, which targets the challenge of reducing chronic disease and illness, a number of which can be attributed to smoking, and to improving the health of all Queenslanders. I am pleased to lend my support to a bill that will have a significant impact on the health of our children in our community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021330"></A>
I cannot refer to these two bills without mentioning the reference in the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill to speech pathologists. As a graduate in speech pathology myself, I am only too well aware--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021331"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Lucas:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 And a particularly articulate one at that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021332"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms FARMER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection. I am only too well aware of the important role that speech pathologists play in our community. Many people think that speech pathologists are just those lovely people who help them to speak nicely. Although that is true in one sense, it in no way reflects the real efforts of speech pathologists who work with incredibly vulnerable people in our community--with stroke patients, with people with acquired brain injuries, with children who may not have started talking until well into their primary school years, with people who stutter so badly that it is impossible for them to be understood, and with people with disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, and with degenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and motor neurone disease. The list goes on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021333"></A>
Queensland leads the way in Australia in recognising the critical role of speech pathologists and, in doing so, recognises how important it is to ensure that the community can be assured of the highest quality speech pathology care. That is why, along with a number of local speech pathologists in the Bulimba electorate, I am extremely disappointed that there has not been agreement with the other states and territories on the national registration of speech pathologists. I cannot praise the honourable Minister for Health highly enough for his continuing efforts to achieve this outcome, which, in the end, will be to the benefit of the many thousands of children and adults whose lives are turned around as a result of the work that they have done, and will do, with speech pathologists. I commend the bills to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Ms DAVIS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Aspley--LNP) (12.27 pm): I rise to speak to the two bills in this cognate debate. My intention is to deal with the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill 2009 subsequently. The Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to make some minor changes to various acts. I note that the minister pointed out in his second reading speech that the government’s proposed amendments were seeking important changes to enhance the safety of all Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021336"></A>
The first part of the bill, though, that I wish it speak to is in regard to altering the Tobacco and Other Smoking Products Act and the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act, which gives the police the authority to pull over anyone smoking in a vehicle when passengers under the age of 16 are present. The evidence of environmental tobacco smoke harm to children in enclosed spaces is extensive and irrefutable. A recent study by the Ontario Tobacco Research Unit concluded that levels of environmental tobacco smoke in vehicles can be far higher than those found in a smoke filled bar. Additionally, even in a vehicle moving at 65 kilometres an hour with the windows open, the level of second-hand smoke is considered harmful to children. Similarly, a recent University of Western Australia study published in the <Hansard-Italic>
Medical Journal of Australia</Hansard-Italic>
 showed teenage asthma risk doubling because of second-hand smoke exposure in cars. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021340"></A>
I understand that there might be some concerns regarding the enforcement of this legislation, but I do not feel that these concerns are insurmountable. In fact, they should not be a barrier to further safety measures. In my opinion, laws relating to smoke-free cars carrying children are likely to be largely self-enforced, since community support for these laws is strong, as demonstrated by a 2004 Cancer Council Victoria survey of over 1,300 Australians in 800 households, showing over 90 per cent supporting banning smoking in cars carrying children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021373"></A>
I support the amendment, as I believe that the community at large would see this as providing improved conditions which ultimately lead to the health and wellbeing of our children. I have mentioned the importance of protecting children from the harmful effects of environmental tobacco smoke, but it is an issue that is also very important for the wider community. Under the proposed legislation local government authorities will be given the authority to make local laws prohibiting smoking at all or part of public transport waiting points or pedestrian malls. I understand that there will be differing regional issues and that is why it is important for councils to formulate these types of laws. It is the most practical way to determine the areas where the bans will apply. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1021376"></A>
I would like to briefly comment on the amendment relating to the expansion of the role of nurse practitioners in Queensland, specifically though with respect to issuing workers compensation certificates. This amendment aims to reduce the demands on the health workforce by better utilising medical resources to improve health service delivery, particularly in rural and remote areas. Whilst explanatory notes suggest that the majority of stakeholders consulted strongly supported the proposed amendments, I do note that the AMAQ does not favour the expansion of the role of nurse practitioners in this regard. I have spoke to a number of medical practitioners who have flagged concerns regarding misdiagnosis of what might appear to be a minor injury and therefore the consequences for the patient could be tragic. They also spoke about the public liability issues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021377"></A>
However, I also had the opportunity of speaking with a rural and remote nurse who has been working in North-Western Queensland as a sole practitioner for 12 years. This woman is a passionate advocate for the profession of nurse practitioner, particularly in what she calls bread-and-butter work. Indeed, she cited the ability to prescribe antibiotics to children in Indigenous communities where she works as an example of where the expanded role would be in the best interests of the health outcomes for the patient. However, her views were quite different with regard to workers compensation matters. She told me that she felt that the nurse practitioner in the circumstances could be left vulnerable when it came to professional indemnity cover. Indeed, she described the scenario for some nurse practitioners to be sitting ducks, particularly if the matter went to court. She advised that presently when it came to workers’ compensation matters she immediately referred the patient to Mount Isa Hospital to be properly assessed and would continue to do so even if this amendment were to be passed. She was also concerned about the extra layers of paperwork and bureaucracy that nurse practitioners would be burdened with when they were already struggling with issues of understaffing and administration, particularly those who work in rural and remote locations. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021378"></A>
I would like to very briefly mention some other parts of the legislation. As outlined in the explanatory notes accompanying the bill, the legislation will enable an exemption so that confidential information can be discussed for the protection, safety or wellbeing of a child. This was a recommendation from the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian and any principle that ensures a safer environment for our children is to be supported. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021379"></A>
Currently there is no legislative requirement for a doctor to alert the Medical Board of Queensland if the doctor is conscious that another has engaged in wrongdoing in the practice of the profession. Under this new legislation, any medical practitioner who becomes conscious or reasonably believes that another medical practitioner has engaged in reportable misconduct is obliged to advise the medical board in writing. I agree that these changes would probably strengthen the community’s confidence in health services in Queensland given the Bundaberg Hospital example. However, as the honourable member for Gaven points out, this legislation could be seen as reacting to a failure by Queensland Health to perform proper probity checks on its staff which, had they been carried out effectively in the first place, would have identified misconduct before the patients came to harm. I support the amendments that have been proposed by the member for Caloundra, in particular in relation to spousal reporting, previous reporting of the alleged misconduct and the protected confidence provision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021380"></A>
The second bill that we are dealing with in this cognate debate is the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill 2009. All Queenslanders deserve access to caring, competent and timely health care. Residents in my electorate need a system that concentrates on preserving their individual health and puts their family’s health first. Part of ensuring that we deliver the best health care is recognising and supporting the professionalism of clinical staff who support and deliver services statewide. In 2005 the then Commonwealth government asked the Productivity Commission to undertake a research study to examine issues impacting on the health professional workforce. The report proposed a single national registration board for health professionals and a single national accreditation board for health professional education and training. At its meeting on 14 July 2006 the Council of Australian Governments decided to institute a single national registration scheme for health professionals beginning with nine professional groups then registered in all states. At its meeting on 26 March 2008 COAG agreed to establish the scheme with the signing of an intergovernmental agreement. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021381"></A>
The national scheme is constituted, amongst other things, to ensure that only those qualified to practise are registered, increased workforce mobility, and the provision of high-quality education and rigorous assessment of those trained overseas. Importantly, the scheme should work in a transparent, accountable, efficient, effective and fair manner where fees are reasonable and where restrictions on the practice of a profession only occur where there are clear community benefits. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021382"></A>
Almost all stakeholders support the concept of a nationally consistent medical practitioner registration model that ensures those doctors who are qualified and safe can work anywhere in Australia. I do highlight a concern that the ministerial council charged with the oversight of the new national boards is accountable to no-one and has reserve powers to give directions despite the members of the council having no expertise. We will be keenly monitoring the exercising of the council’s powers in respect to accreditation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021383"></A>
I am very encouraged to see that there has been a last minute alteration to the bill requiring the council to give consideration to the potential impact of a direction related to a proposed accreditation standard on the quality and safety of health care. It is also encouraging that there is a new requirement that the council publish the reasons underlying any direction regarding an accreditation standard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021384"></A>
The protection of the public should be the highest priority for all governments and the protection and ongoing support of those who work in the health system needs to be strengthened. The residents in my electorate continually provide feedback to my office relating to the litany of spectacular breakdowns in this portfolio since the start of this now 11-year-old government. It is my sincere hope that by supporting the thrust of this bill Queensland’s once-proud health system might receive the medicine it deserves rather than the placebo lip-service we have come to expect from this government. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr MESSENGER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Burnett--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.36 pm): I note that the minister in his second reading speech stated that the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 was introduced into this place to enhance the safety of all Queenslanders. In the course of this debate I will be speaking about ways of enhancing the safety of my constituents in the Burnett in the public health system. In introducing the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill 2009 he said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1021387"></A>
...amendments seek to boost public safety protection by ensuring health practitioners are suitably trained and qualified to practise in a competent and ethical manner; </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021388"></A>
I note that our shadow minister indicated that we will be supporting both bills. I commend him for his analysis of both pieces of legislation. I note also that we will have reservations in supporting this. After rigorous examination, I am happy to join with other members of the LNP in supporting this legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021389"></A>
The shadow minister made comment during the cognate debate that 21 acts will be amended. One of the key objectives of this legislation, as stated by the minister, is to safeguard patients from the professional misconduct of medical practitioners with the introduction of mandatory reporting. Unlike the minister who made an extraordinary outburst during the shadow minister’s speech during this debate, I understand how careful we have to be in discussing the Bundaberg health crisis as there are matters before the court. However, in the context of this debate, I think that it is timely to remind the House that in the lead-up to the public exposure of the Bundaberg health crisis, there were 22 official complaints by doctors and nurses to the director of medical services--Dr Darren Keating--at the Bundaberg Base Hospital. Retired Supreme Court judge and royal commissioner, the honourable Geoffrey Davies, made 14 adverse findings and four recommendations of legal action and criminal proceedings against Dr Darren Keating who was the director of medical services at the Bundaberg Base Hospital. Even the independent Butler legal report commissioned by the Queensland Police Service confirms that there is sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case against Dr Keating under the Criminal Code of attempted fraud. Under this government’s management of legal matters surrounding Dr Keating, he escaped all charges. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024870"></A>
The point that I am making is that people think that there was silence from the medical community of the Bundaberg Base Hospital. There was not silence. Many people here may be thinking that the mandatory reporting set out in the legislation before the House will somehow fix the culture. </Hansard-Body>

 I suggest those members who are interjecting read page 417, paragraph 6.270 of the report of the Davies royal commission. It states that 22 incidents or issues were formally reported in one form or another. Those 22 official complaints lodged with Keating regarding a doctor’s performance included multiple complaints from eight doctors, three nurses and patients as well. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024878"></A>
During this debate it is worthwhile reminding ourselves that as we pass legislation mandating the reporting of professional misconduct, we cannot just sit back on our heels, pat ourselves on the back and say, ‘Job well done. Problem fixed.’ This government actively spreads the myth that Queensland healthcare professionals are breaking their code of conduct if they confide in members of this House. I would simply remind healthcare professionals that if they do not trust the reporting system that we are debating today that this government has set up, they are still allowed to take their concerns to their local member of parliament. Is that not right, Minister? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024882"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The minister avoids the question. I understand that because if he had answered truthfully he would have to confirm that it is still legal for workers of Queensland Health to come to members of this chamber if they have concerns. They can go through the mandatory reporting process and they can come to members of this chamber. They would not be breaking any code of conduct of Queensland Health. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024883"></A>
While the government has the public believing that it is the medical practitioners that they should be scared of, in reality when it comes to medical incompetence the persons they should be scared of are the Labor politicians who have been responsible for the underfunding and underresourcing of our health system over an extended period: Beattie, Edmond, Nuttall, Robertson and now Minister Lucas. One of those was a convicted criminal. Three voted in this House, if you include former Premier Beattie, to protect him from a CMC recommendation that he face a tribunal of fact over lying to the parliament. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024885"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw. I apologise. The minister says in his second reading speech--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024887"></A>
This bill represents a quantum leap forward in improving Australia’s health care system for the better. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024888"></A>
If the government wants to produce a quantum leap forward in improving Queensland’s health system, I suggest that we have a better chance of achieving that goal--that quantum leap forward--if we put the character and the performance of Labor health ministers under the microscope rather than healthcare professionals. Year after year, decade after decade in Queensland we have been burdened with health ministers who have been inept, arrogant, out of touch, criminals--official criminals--or all of the above. The Labor Party of Queensland has produced health ministers who have not had the courage, strength, ability or influence to properly fund and manage our public healthcare system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024891"></A>
The Davies royal commission, which took a broad look at the Queensland health system, found underfunding of Queensland Health and particularly identified underfunding in the late 1990s and at the beginning of the 21st century--all periods when this government had tenure and control of the public healthcare system. Davies said at 6.14--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024895"></A>
Because of the rapid growth in Queensland’s population, in the years from 2000 to 2003, Queensland recorded annual reductions in health expenditure per person. Professor Stable, former Director-General of Queensland Health, gave evidence that he had had an ongoing argument with Government since 1996 about the under-funding of Queensland Health. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024896"></A>
I acknowledge that over the last 20 years there has been 18 years of Labor rule and Labor mismanagement of the health department. Queensland expenditure per person on public hospitals is below the national average. What is the expenditure now per person on public hospitals? Is it below the national average? Davies continues--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024898"></A>
A more compelling analysis of comparative funding, for present purposes, is public hospital funding. The Commonwealth Productivity Commission, which seeks to compare government services across jurisdictions, highlights a growing gap between Queensland expenditure per person on public hospitals and national average expenditure. The 2003 Productivity Commission report records that in 2000-01, Queensland recorded the lowest government real recurrent expenditure per person on public hospitals ... at $660 per person, well below the national average of $776 per person, a gap of $116 per person. This trend has continued. For the 2004 financial year, Queensland again recorded the lowest government real recurrent expenditure per person on public hospitals (in 2001-02 dollars) at $712 per person--</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024899"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Order! Member for Burnett, I draw your attention to the purpose of the bill. The bills are for particular purposes. These are not appropriation bills. I draw your attention to the purposes of the bill and I ask you to come back to the purpose of the bill. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024900"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I note that one of the key purposes of the bill is to enhance the safety of all Queenslanders. A properly funded and resourced health system in Queensland, of course, enhances the safety of all Queenslanders in relation to this public service. It boosts the public safety protection by ensuring health practitioners are suitably trained and qualified. We cannot have suitably qualified and trained health practitioners without proper funding. I am sure honourable members will agree with that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024901"></A>
Underfunding of public hospitals, Davies says, is exacerbated by several factors. First of all, Queensland is the most decentralised state. Secondly, Queensland has the highest level of population and of ageing population growth. Thirdly, Queensland has a lower than average number of medical practitioners. This was at the time of the Davies royal commission. There is also the problem of defective allocation process and historical budgets. Davies writes--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024903"></A>
As a result, these increases in labour and non-labour costs allowed by Treasury never kept up with the real increases in costs. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<A ID="pgfId-1024904"></A>
...</Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024905"></A>
These budgets were further eroded through an ‘efficiency dividend’. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1024906"></A>
Those opposite talk about an efficiency dividend, but they had an inbuilt efficiency dividend within one of their largest systems, as Commissioner Davies found out. Davies went on--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024908"></A>
This was not a dividend but a reduction made each year on the assumption that increased efficiencies would be made during the course of the year. This was invariably a reduction of one or two per cent each year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<A ID="pgfId-1024909"></A>
...</Hansard-Centre-Dots>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1024910"></A>
This was in addition to the pressure placed on District Managers, like Mr Leck and Mr Allsopp, to maintain budget integrity. A budget overrun was viewed very seriously, and little flexibility was permitted. District Managers had been dismissed for over-running budget. The Queensland Nurses Union summarised the practice accurately in the following submission:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Staying within budget (while at the same time having to meet unrealistic performance objectives) is the overriding imperative in Queensland Health: All else appears to take second place to this. The primacy of the budget bottom line is demonstrated again and again. In 1999 the whole District Executive at Toowoomba Health Service District (HSD) were removed for failing to come in on budget. Not long after that the District Manager in Cairns HSD was dismissed for reportedly failing to come in on budget. These dismissals were powerful symbols for the rest of the system and helped achieve better budget compliance by instilling fear of job loss on senior management across the agency, a fear that was in turn passed down to middle management and beyond. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

In the years since early 2005 this government has been forced to address the underlying funding for Health. The state Health budget has increased from around $4 billion to $9 billion. I am sure that the health minister will correct me if I am wrong. It is probably closer to $10 billion now. The government has more than doubled the allocation of funds. I remind the minister that it was from the courage, pain and suffering of our medical professionals and the patients at Bundaberg Base Hospital that the rest of the state benefited from the overall increase in the state Health budget. Given our history, the government should have provided enough funds to deliver the best resourced and the best funded healthcare facility in Australia. I am here in the chamber today to tell the health minister that we in the Burnett and Bundaberg region have not received our fair share of that increase. Our medical professionals work miracles every day without enough resources. A recent AMA report showed that the average number of beds in Queensland, expressed as a ratio of per thousand head of population, was 2.5 public hospital beds per 1,000 head of population. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I return to the cognate debate of the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill. Once again, I remind this place that Bundaberg Hospital has not received its fair share of funding in the Health budget. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you will agree with me that one of the central purposes of this bill is mandatory reporting of incidents that could endanger public health and safety. Recently we had an incident there, in February this year, where a nurse who would be covered by this particular piece of legislation reported serious--</Hansard-Body>

The member is an experienced member of parliament. Everybody else in this chamber on both sides can address the bill. He has taken some latitude. He does not have the capacity to do it. I ask that he be required to speak to the bill. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1027598"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I withdraw. I am giving the Deputy Premier a practical example of where this legislation would apply. This nurse reported serious offences that happened at Bundaberg Base Hospital. Her report generated four to five independent reports. One was sent through to the CMC. It was referred to the Ethical Standards Unit. If this legislation were in place, there would have been mandatory reporting requirements. Her work colleagues would have also been covered under the mandatory reporting requirements.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027599"></A>
In the short time left to me I would like to praise this nurse, because this nurse forced this government to spend a quarter of a million dollars on the upgrade of the emergency department at Bundaberg Base Hospital. This is a practical example of what happens when people speak out. I think this report should give confidence to the families of the Burnett and Bundaberg region. It is a big pat on the back for our dedicated medical staff. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027603"></A>
There are a number of things wrong with the Bundaberg Base Hospital, as I have just said, and it relates to underresourcing and underfunding. We have half the number of beds that we should have. We should have 160 hospital beds. The lack of funding and the underresourcing--not having enough resourced and equipped hospital beds--are causing extra pressure to be placed on our medical staff. That is what causes all the problems--this constant pressure of patients coming in and not having enough beds. This minister does not appear as though he would like to address those problems. Every time this is raised in this place he likes to shout people down and stop people from talking about it. I think he is being a little bit precious about it all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027604"></A>
We have to learn a lot of lessons. I note that the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill 2009 talks about the registration of dentists. I take the short time left to me to note that we have a dental waiting list in Bundaberg-Burnett of seven-plus years. This must be addressed. </Hansard-Body>

 (Gregory--LNP) (12.57 pm): It is with pleasure that I rise to speak in this cognate debate on the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill and the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill 2009. It was very gratifying to hear some very worthwhile contributions in the House yesterday from the shadow minister and two medical practitioners, the member for Moggill and the member for Gaven. I always respect professional people, whoever they are and from whatever walk of life. I think it is important from time to time that we recognise the input from professional people in a field that they know something about, especially when that field is applicable to them. I thought that was some very good input from both of those members who are medical practitioners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027615"></A>
These are very important pieces of legislation. I want to touch firstly on the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill 2009. There are many aspects that confront the medical profession and the health department today, especially in relation to overseas trained doctors. Overseas trained doctors are an integral part of our medical services, not only here in Queensland but also in Australia. I know that there are many overseas trained doctors who work in my electorate. They do very valuable work and are highly regarded for the work they are doing in rural Queensland. I have to say that, on the whole, they are very well received and very well respected by the local communities, because we in Western Queensland know what it is like to not have a doctor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1027618"></A>
We are also blessed in Western Queensland with that mantle of safety called the Royal Flying Doctor Service, something that is absolutely sacred to our part of the world and something that I think is sacred to Australia as a whole. It has provided medical services for many, many years to those people in isolated, remote areas who do not have access to a doctor on a daily basis. I applaud the Royal Flying Doctor Service for the work it does and the men and women in that service who over a long period of time have made a great contribution and a great personal contribution. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1032698"></A>
The Building and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 contains key components of the government’s decisive strategy to help address climate change through improvements in the building sector, while keeping its election commitments. The built environment provides some of the most promising opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions of any sector. The government is acting decisively with its innovative and nation-leading sustainable housing policy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032699"></A>
This bill will amend the Building Act 1975 and the Body Corporate and Community Management Act 1997 to implement the government’s ‘Ban the Banners’ election policy, ensuring conditions that are placed on new development will not lock in bad practices like requiring dark coloured roofs. This will also help address climate change impacts from our considerable existing building stock by invalidating new covenants and provisions of body corporate by-laws and statements restricting owners from using sustainable features, such as photovoltaic cells or solar hot-water systems. The policy gives choice and freedom back to homeowners and builders so they can build as green as they want to. The policy will also help to reduce the cost of homes by allowing prospective homeowners to choose designs and features with a small environmental impact as well as a small impact on their pockets. Owners will be able to choose whether they want rendering, ensuites and double garages, and they will be able to choose the size of their home. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032700"></A>
The bill will introduce a nation-leading sustainability declaration to help to raise awareness and drive housing markets to reflect the true value of sustainable housing features. The declaration is a simple mandatory form to be completed before a house, town house or unit is sold in Queensland, it will be user friendly and it can be completed by the homeowner or a delegate. Advertising such as web listings and especially created signage will need to reference where the sustainability declaration can be viewed. The declaration will also need to be made available during open-house inspections as well as within a reasonable time frame if a copy is requested by a person interested in purchasing the property. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032701"></A>
Queensland will be the first state in Australia to implement a comprehensive sustainability declaration during the sale of homes. The declaration will be mandatory from 1 January 2010 and it will cover a range of sustainable features. The declaration must be completed after engaging an agent to sell the property, and the property is not allowed to be advertised for sale until it is completed. Prospective purchasers will also be able to get an indication of the ongoing water and electricity savings that could be achieved by certain features, including energy-efficient lighting and insulation. Just as many people look at fuel economy and ongoing running costs when buying a car, sustainability features should be an important consideration for prospective homeowners. The declaration will not complicate real estate sales as obligations will not be attached to or affect contracts of sale. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032702"></A>
With intensifying urban development, it is vital we protect the health and amenity of residents. This bill supports the introduction of a new building code that will ensure that development near major transport routes is constructed in a manner that will achieve an adequate level of noise reduction for occupants. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032703"></A>
Consultation in 2008 indicated strong support for a new process and code setting noise standards for buildings in transport corridors. This will provide certainty for developers and reduce delays and holding costs for developments. Mandatory requirements of this nature will be an Australian first. Local governments will also have the ability to designate transport noise corridors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032704"></A>
This bill will expand the role of building surveying technicians to allow them to work in the private sector, enhancing career opportunities for building industry professionals and assisting to address the looming shortage of building certifiers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032705"></A>
Using learning from the Binary Industries fire, the bill provides more clarity on the classification and use of buildings. For any changes of use within building classifications, where the change would trigger new building work, a new certificate of classification will be required. The bill ensures that, for any future changes of the building code classification rules, offences will only apply to acts that occur after the amendments have been made so building owners who complied with the rules in effect at the time will not be impacted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032706"></A>
Building certifiers will have to have regard for guidelines made under the Building Act. New transitional arrangements for changes to the building assessment provisions will allow certifiers to use earlier provisions where there has been substantial planning at the design stage. Alternative building solutions will be assessable rather than self-assessable to ensure the use of performance measures is properly overseen by a certifier. The bill will cut red tape by allowing certifiers to send approval documents to the building owner or applicant once a copy of the approval documents has been sent to the local government with the lodgement fee.</Hansard-Body>

This bill introduces compulsory acquisition powers for koala habitat outside the urban footprint in South-East Queensland. The introduction of specific acquisition powers for koala conservation will contribute to the government’s koala crisis response strategy announced in December 2008.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032708"></A>
The acquisition provisions proposed will be limited in their application to the local government areas where koala populations are known to be under the most threat in South-East Queensland. These provisions are to be exceptional circumstance provisions only and used once all other options have been exhausted, and there will be guidelines in place to confirm this approach. </Hansard-Body>

Minor amendments to the Animal Management (Cats and Dogs) Act 2008 will prevent cats and dogs under eight weeks of age from being microchipped, unless under advice from a veterinary surgeon. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032710"></A>
The bill amends the Sustainable Planning Act 2009 to require that a decision notice issued by a building certifier must state the classification or proposed classification of a building. Important transition provisions are also contained within the bill, such as a reference to the Local Government Act 2009 in the Sustainable Planning Act 2009 may be taken to be a reference to the Local Government Act 1993 until the new Local Government Act 2009 commences. This bill also amends the Plumbing and Drainage Act 2002 to replace the Plumber and Drainers Board with the Plumbing Industry Council. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1032711"></A>
With this bill, the government is taking decisive steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the building sector and to fulfil our election commitments. We are leading the nation with these innovative measures, the majority of which are the first of their kind in Australia. This legislation will make Queensland a better place to live while protecting our unique environment and way of life for generations to come. I commend the bill to the House.</Hansard-Body>

Mr JOHNSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gregory--LNP) (2.39 pm): As I was saying before the break in relation to the work that flying doctors do in rural and regional Queensland, another very important facet of the Flying Doctor Service is the faculty of mental health. That is an area of major concern to many people regardless of where they live in this state. A lot of people over recent years have been affected by mental health. It is an issue that needs to be well and truly canvassed and one that we need to recognise is out there all of the time.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035583"></A>
In relation to the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill 2009, I want to talk about the issue of attracting overseas doctors. That is an area that gets a lot of scrutiny here in Queensland. There has been a lot of controversy about that over recent years. These doctors have to confront the Australian Medical Council, which is fair enough, to do an exam to be registered. They have to complete the first part before they apply for that registration. That has to be done in the overseas country which they come from. The most important thing is that none of these regulations are lifted, and I know they will not be. Doctors from the United Kingdom and New Zealand certainly get the first breaks when it comes to entering Australia or Queensland to work in Queensland Health operations or facilities. Once they pass the exam, they then apply for the second part to get a visa. This again is limited registration.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035584"></A>
There is a clinical interview conducted by a panel. The panel will then do an evaluation of their skill set and knowledge and find them a position where their skill set is appropriate for them to go to. This is done by the Medical Board. I know there are many hurdles to go through, but it is very important that these hurdles are jumped in a proper manner so we are getting the proper professionals to work within our hospitals in Queensland or in private practice. The one complaint that I get from doctors is about red tape. I hope an evaluation can be done so that sometimes that can be expedited. It is important that we invite British trained doctors, doctors from reputable European countries whose training methods we respect, and New Zealand doctors, as I mentioned earlier, to work in Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035586"></A>
I have had doctors say to me on numerous occasions, ‘We really don’t want to be taking doctors from Third World countries because they have needs in their own countries,’ and that is a fair comment. But it is a free world we live in, or most times it is anyway--thank God it is for us--and people can go where they choose. Doctors who come to our country must meet the criteria set down by the medical boards and, in this case, Queensland Health.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035588"></A>
I want to quickly touch on the issue of Blackwater in my electorate. I want to pay tribute to the mining companies around Blackwater which in recent days have made an announcement of $210,000 a year over the next three years to help Queensland Health attract a second medical professional to Blackwater. Blackwater is a growing town. It is one of the wealth generators in the region of Central Queensland with the coalmining industry, the cattle industry and the magnificent grain industry adjacent to that area. A special funding agreement has been struck with Queensland Health and five coalmining companies: BM Alliance Coal Operations, Cook Colliery, Wesfarmers Curragh, Jellinbah Mining and Yarrabee Coal Co. I want to say to those five companies: thank you very much on behalf of the community. I have spoken with Dr Coralee Barker, who is the regional director of Queensland Health based in Rockhampton for that region. This is certainly going to help her and Queensland Health attract a second doctor to Blackwater.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035596"></A>
Blackwater has been going through some very trying times recently. If we are going to encourage people to live in these communities, it is very important to get the basics right. When we talk about the basics, if we are going to attract families to these places, it is about medical services, education facilities, recreational facilities--and the list goes on. But the No. 1 priority is health. I have said over a long period of time, and I have said it in this House, we have only two hospitals in the Gregory electorate, which covers just under 400,000 square kilometres, where mothers can give birth to their infants--that is, Longreach and Emerald. I know the Deputy Premier was formerly a minister for infrastructure and transport. As the Minister for Health, he would understand fully where I am coming from.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035598"></A>
It is important to encourage private enterprise to build infrastructure in these places where we can entice people to these communities. Places like Blackwater are no exception. Those coalmining towns are good places to live. They are community oriented. They have a purpose and they have a heart. The heart, I can assure you, is beating well. I think a place like Blackwater can complement Emerald, only being 70-odd kilometres apart. Those two towns can grow in unison as one of the metropolises of the Central Highlands. It is a place where we can encourage population to go to by way of private enterprise investing and creating an environment where jobs will spring up as a result of not only the coalmining industry but also other industries associated with the region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035600"></A>
I think that is what we are about as members of parliament and as leaders in our communities to see firsthand how we can encourage people to move out of South-East Queensland or move away from the coast and live in inland towns. I cannot speak highly enough of the opportunities that are available to people in these places. In the Central Highlands region alone, the population was 29,256 in 2006. That is expected to blow out to well over 35,000 in the next 10 to 12 years. I think these are figures of growth that a lot of people dream about. It is up 2.6 per cent on the 2005 level, which was higher than the growth rates for Fitzroy of 2.4 per cent and Queensland of two per cent.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035605"></A>
Over the past five years the population of the Central Highlands region has grown at an average annual rate of 2.3 per cent, slightly below the average of Queensland over the same period of 2.4 per cent. I heard the Treasurer say the other day that the population of Queensland is growing by approximately 2,100 people per week. We are talking about a health bill here today. We can talk about all different bills in this House, but I think it is important to expose to the people of Queensland the opportunities that lie outside the south-east corner.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes. When we get a population influx, the first thing that women will ask is, ‘What are the health facilities? What are the educational facilities? What are the recreation facilities?’ And it explodes from there. You see people move into those areas who go and make a life there. Some people in Western Queensland towns have gone there for two years or 12 months and finished up giving the whole of their working life to that environment. They love the place.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1035609"></A>
Over the past few years there has been too much emphasis on export earning. The biggest export earning we have had in the bush is exporting our kids away to the coast for a secondary education for those towns that do not have access to a high school and then ultimately tertiary education or a career path in the trades, but now these people are coming back. I have had a lot of city people say to me, ‘We wish we had found these places before.’ This goes to show that that is what it is all about. It is about exposing how we can grow these populations and, therefore, with a growth in population we will get these professionals going there. We will have doctors, dentists and other health professionals like physiotherapists and pharmacists who will go to those places, set up their businesses, rear their families and make a very valuable contribution to those regions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038442"></A>
I think what we should be about as legislators and visionaries is enhancing growth and job opportunities across Queensland. There is no doubt that the health facilities in the south-east are overtaxed. I compliment Queensland Health on the services we have in Western Queensland. We have a magnificent set-up in Longreach. In most western towns we have a good set-up. The one failing I see--and this goes with the times--is that a lot of the maternity sections in our rural hospitals are closed. Indemnity insurance is one of the main factors contributing to that situation. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038446"></A>
The fact of the matter is that some of these western towns have become smaller. People have to recognise that we cannot have regional hospitals in every one of these towns. When it comes to fully costing these medical services today, the cost is prohibitive. We now have bitumen roads between most of these places and we have aerial services that complement our doctors in those areas. There has been a lot of progress in 40 or 50 years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038447"></A>
I have said before that when my children were born we had the services of the flying gynaecologist and obstetrician and surgeons. We still have those services today. It is absolutely paramount that we retain those services in these places. They are sacrosanct to the ongoing mantle of safety that people feel they have in those regions. That is something they consider when they want to move to a place and live there. It is always good to know that we have doctors in places like Barcaldine, Blackall, Winton, Augathella, Charleville, Blackwater, Emerald, Clermont and the places in between. But we cannot have them in every town. I am well aware of that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038450"></A>
The important thing is to recognise the needs. One of the biggest costs in Western Queensland at the moment is temp nurses. The department has to find nurses to staff those hospitals. That is an horrific cost--a cost that they cannot budget on. It is a cost that is eating the heart out of our health budget in the west. When the department has to pay over and above normal wages and has to pay for people’s transport to the town and everything else, the cost becomes prohibitive and it blows budgets out of all proportion. The most important thing is to retain the services we have and through some sort of marketing process encourage people to live in these areas. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038451"></A>
The other issue I want to touch on with regard to the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill is smoking in motor vehicles and in confined spaces. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038452"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Lucas:</Hansard-Member-Down>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038453"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No way in the world. I have never smoked in my life. It was not fun after you left school. I could not afford to smoke and drink so I stuck with drinking. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038454"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Hinchliffe:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Did you do that in the truck? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038455"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I certainly did not. When we walk down the street past the front doors of some buildings we find that a lot of the people who are smoking are not the regulated distance from those doorways. It does not matter whether you are a smoker or not; when you walk through a puff of smoke, before you know where you are you are gasping for breath. I think this is good legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038456"></A>
The only thing I can condemn this legislation for is that it does not ban smoking totally. I think we should ban it everywhere. I am sorry to all the smokers, but if we banned smoking everywhere we would not have half the medical problems we have today. Doctors would have more money for health services. We would not have people affected by emphysema and the other diseases associated with smoking. This is a very good aspect of the legislation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038457"></A>
I suggest to the Deputy Premier that the government conduct a campaign in our schools to tell our children where people can and cannot smoke. I reckon kids are the best asset in terms of telling people what they can and cannot do. They are honest and upfront in their evaluation of situations. They might say to their mum or dad, ‘You should not smoke.’ A parent may then give it away. It would be good if that happened. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038459"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Lucas:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 A lot of women give up when they get pregnant. That is the impetus for them to give it up permanently. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038460"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Fair comment. This is a very important aspect of this legislation. We need to market this part of the legislation because smoking is something that affects more people than we realise. People may give it away now but in four or five years it could destroy their health. It is with much pleasure that I support this legislation. </Hansard-Body>

Mr HORAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba South--LNP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(2.55 pm): The legislation that we are debating cognately covers a lot of aspects. I will firstly deal with the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill, which deals with patient safety and the health and wellbeing of the public through a more flexible and sustainable health workforce. I note that it is another cog in working towards the full implementation of a national scheme for 10 health professions. A further four will be included in two years time. Dental technicians and speech pathologists who are currently registered in Queensland have not been included in the national scheme but will continue to be registered on a state basis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038464"></A>
Speech pathology is a very important profession. Very often young children who are falling behind developmentally only need speech pathology to learn to speak and communicate well, and it takes away their lack of confidence and helps them keep up. Otherwise they are always behind, and that affects them when they become teenagers and later when they go to work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038465"></A>
I wanted to mention a very important issue we have in Toowoomba and south-west Queensland. I think I have spoken about this in parliament before. I have made a deputation to the minister at a community cabinet. The issue is people who have had polio. It is a finite number of people. Since the advent of oral Sabin, polio is not an issue in Australia. There are about 105 of them in Toowoomba and south-western Queensland--out as fair as Quilpie and up to Kingaroy. Many are finding that the effects of polio are coming back on them in older age particularly with regard to their limbs, bones and so forth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038467"></A>
There is another aspect to this. Many of these people had very sad childhoods. We hear of people who have been institutionalised. They were little kids at the time. The large percentage of the polio cases in Queensland were on the Southern Downs. Sister Elizabeth Kenny was very famous for the work she did in trying to provide rehabilitation for these kids. She was widely recognised in America. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1038470"></A>
A lot of these little kids were taken to places like Mount Lofty, which was an old nursing home facility. They were away from their families for a long time whilst they were treated or tried to recover. For many of them it was very lonely and sad. The conditions were not good. In some cases these little kids were put into iron lungs to assist them with their breathing. They would be hooked up to a motorised pump. They had a difficult childhood and a very difficult illness to overcome.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041383"></A>
A proper specialist assessment is needed to be made of these people--and I have spoken to the minister about this issue--associated with a multidisciplinary rehabilitation system. I know--possibly since we spoke--that some funding of around about $800,000 was provided to put together this unit. Two of the three staff have been employed. I know that the downstairs area that they looked at at the Mount Lofty Heights Nursing Home was not suitable, because these people need to be able to be near the door. Many of them have difficulty getting up and have difficulty walking. In some cases some of them have had to go back to using callipers and walking sticks as a result of their post-polio syndromes. So it is important that we are able to find a place where these various professions that we are talking about in terms of their registration today, which are so important, are able to be brought together to provide that care. But, first of all, these people need an assessment, and that assessment needs to be done by a highly skilled specialist. I have spoken to the minister about this issue. There is such a specialist at the Toowoomba Base Hospital. I reiterate that I am talking about a finite number of patients who are elderly--about the same number of people who have MS. The MS association is able to provide a support worker for these people. That is what we need for those post-polio people--a system of assessment and a system to provide the rehabilitation and treatment that they need.</Hansard-Body>

The other bill that we are debating in cognate covers mainly issues to do with smoking, the safeguard of patients with regard to the professional misconduct of medical practitioners and the mandatory reporting of such misconduct and also issues relating to the Health Quality and Complaints Commission. Other speakers have mentioned the amendments that this bill makes in relation to smoking. It is amazing how community attitudes to smoking have changed. I think it is great to see the reduction in the incidence of smoking and the way in which so many people now understand the enormous array of dangerous, lethal and debilitating conditions that they can suffer from as a result of smoking. Sometimes those conditions can occur from smoking in childhood.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041388"></A>
In one of my first rugby league contracts, the club I went to had a player/coach whose job we all envied, because he was a Rothmans rep. In those days, it was a glamourous job. There were girls who went around with him to sportsmen functions. Everyone at those sportsmen functions received a complimentary packet of Rothmans at their table. That is how much times have changed. You just would not even consider doing that now.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041390"></A>
Smoking related illnesses such as stroke, heart disease, lung cancer and other cancers such as tongue cancer and facial cancer are just terrible and they place a huge burden on the health system. We only have to look at the forms that people have to fill out when they go to see their GP to see that one of the first questions that is asked is, ‘Do you smoke?’ Insurance companies ask the some question. It is a major issue in our society. Unlike other activities that are dangerous to your health, such as eating fatty foods or drinking too much alcohol, smoking can affect other people.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041391"></A>
This legislation looks to protect children in cars. Although it would perhaps be a difficult law to police, I think the intent is good. It creates the ethos that it is not right to smoke in a confined space with other people, but particularly with children who are not able to say, ‘Don’t do that’ or do not have the power to stop people from smoking around them. So I think this amendment is a good safeguard protection for our children. It also enhances the message about smoking. This bill increases the accountability of the Health Quality and Complaints Commission in terms of requiring it to provide impact assessment statements before it amends any standards. That independent commission plays a very important role.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041392"></A>
I want to bring to the attention of the parliament, and particularly to the minister, an issue regarding the quality care of patients at the Baillie Henderson Hospital in Toowoomba. Over the years the role of that hospital has changed dramatically. Once we had a mental health system whereby there were thousands at Baillie Henderson, thousands at the facility in Goodna and many up at Charters Towers. With the advent of the 10-year mental health plan, those types of facilities now provide only secure care, long-term care or chronic care. Hospitals are now used for short-term care--that is, for around about a 10- or 11-day length of stay. We also have community health care for those who are being treated for their illness in the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041394"></A>
There is a secure unit at Baillie Henderson and there are other units for some extremely difficult, chronic and long-term cases. I want to talk about the issue of 13 patients at that facility--the numbers have diminished over the years because of age--with an intellectual disability who have been kept in a ward called Browne ward for many years. Their numbers have gradually dwindled down to 13. There is a proposal to amalgamate the people in that ward with the people in another ward called the Morris-Mouatt ward.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041397"></A>
The patients in the Morris-Mouatt ward have extremely difficult conditions or illnesses. As a result, certain things are not able to be there--buttons, zippers, pillows. There have to be very safe conditions in that ward because of the nature of those people’s illnesses. There is a concern by people who really care that, by amalgamating the wards and putting those people who have an intellectual disability into the Morris-Mouatt ward, that will decrease their ability to have the best life possible. If members understood the nature of the two wards, the nature of the conditions or the illnesses of the people involved, they would understand what I am on about. Those who know and understand Baillie Henderson and some of the difficult cases that that hospital deals with would understand what I am saying.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041398"></A>
So I ask the Minister for Health to have a compassionate look at this matter. I know that the issue is to do with the age of the facility, contemporary care and possible concerns from the official visitor, but I think we should listen to those people who really know and understand the effect that the movement of those 13 patients with intellectual disabilities into this other ward will have. I have provided some detail to the minister, which his staff would have noted. I think this issue has to be looked at very carefully, because there is very genuine concern that this move into the Morris-Mouatt ward would reduce the lifestyle or care of those patients with intellectual disabilities. I understand the change and the need to have contemporary and modern facilities, but I think the nature of the mix of patients is what will bring down the quality of life for those people with intellectual disabilities if their ward is merged with that other ward.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1041399"></A>
I refer to the ongoing issue of dental waiting lists. I notice that the matter of the registration of dentists and dental technicians is contained in the first bill that we are debating. The main issues that I wanted to speak about today were the issue of the post-polio people and the potential problems of merging those two wards at Baillie Henderson Hospital.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044304"></A>
I have a personal view that the continued enlargement of the health districts is not the best and optimum system of management. Toowoomba’s health system is run from Ipswich. The head of the region is based in Ipswich. I am a great believer in a flat management system: the smallest number of chiefs possible and the maximum number of people actually providing patient care. I believe that a person in the position of regional coordinator could look at issues such as whether there is a shortage of health professionals in a district, arrange for people to visit where necessary or undertake recruitment. I am very disappointed to think that the Toowoomba health district is not being run from there. We are a city of almost 100,000 people. Our council employs about 160 people. We are almost the capital city of South-Western Queensland with many services such as education, health, legal and accounting, mining and agriculture. Our city should be able to have a CEO based in Toowoomba so that things can be done. </Hansard-Body>

I mentioned earlier the issue of trying to get together this rehabilitation facility for people post polio, amputees, spinal injury victims, stroke victims and so forth. So much time has been taken since the money has been available going through issues of business cases, finding a location, getting the wrong location and then going through another business case as to how to market it and promote it to those who need it and GPs. We need someone in charge who can say, ‘This is what has to be done. This is the direction from the minister’s office.’ Let us and go out and do it rather than go for many months without the service being available or a patient being seen. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SHINE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Toowoomba North--ALP) (3.11 pm): I take this opportunity to congratulate the people who work at the Toowoomba Base Hospital and Baillie Henderson--Baillie Henderson being a hospital in my electorate. My association with Pam Lane from Queensland Health, who divides her time between Ipswich and Toowoomba, has been a good one. My observation is that many goals have been attained over recent times at the Toowoomba Base Hospital. I congratulate all of the staff at that hospital for those achievements. I am happy to support my friend from Toowoomba South with respect to the problem that he raised with the minister in his speech with respect to the proposed amalgamations of those wards at Baillie Henderson. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044309"></A>
What has been achieved by one of these bills is the national registration of the medical profession. It is good to see. I make the observation that the legal profession is way ahead of the medical profession in that regard. It is good to see the medical profession following suit. It probably took a legally qualified person in charge of Health in Queensland to ensure that this happened to the medical profession. I congratulate the minister for his efforts if that be the case. </Hansard-Body>

As a former very heavy smoker, from the ages of 14 to 52, I am very pleased to see this legislation before the House.

Mr SHINE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the honourable minister’s kind interjection. I am here because of the medical facilities and skills that we have in Queensland. I am certainly not here because of the years of smoking. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044313"></A>
What is being proposed is banning smoking in vehicles that contain children under 16 years of age and giving local authorities powers to regulate smoking in malls and at public transport waiting points. I listened with interest to the suggestion of the member for Gregory that smoking be banned altogether. I have some sympathy with that. I make the point that excessive drinking is a problem in the community. I do not know whether the honourable member for Gregory was advocating that something of the same nature should be done with respect to alcohol. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044314"></A>
As has been indicated by other speakers, it is very important that we do something about the incidence of smoking. Much has already been done. I recall that the initial laws restricting smoking in public places were introduced by then Minister Edmond some years ago. As has been mentioned by previous speakers and by the member for Toowoomba South, the number of deaths in Queensland and the burden on our hospital system as a consequence of smoking are well known and, importantly, have become well known in the community as a whole. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044315"></A>
Far fewer people smoke these days than when I started work. I think the number of men, for example, who smoked in the sixties was probably in the order of 60 or 70 per cent. Now it is probably down to between 20 and 30 per cent. The message is getting through. Government measures warning people of the hazards of smoking and the work of the health professionals are paying off, and I congratulate them for the efforts they have made. Diminishing the number of people who smoke has a high priority in the government’s Toward Q2 2020 vision. The goal is to make Queenslanders the healthiest people in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044316"></A>
I am also happy to see the mandatory reporting provisions. We cannot make reference to a case that is before the courts at the moment, but we all know what we are referring to. Obviously the mandatory reporting of serious misconduct is something that needs to happen. We cannot afford the niceties that might have existed between professionals in years gone by, where they would tend to try to do the right thing by one another. It probably happened in the legal profession and other professions as well. In this day and age that is not acceptable, and I congratulate the minister and his colleagues interstate, because this is an Australia-wide move, for what they have done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044317"></A>
We are also providing for national registration and accreditation. This interim measure is being taken because the national program will not apply until 1 July next year. The other major issue before us here is national registration. Instead of having 70 bodies dealing with the registration and accreditation of these professional bodies around Australia there will be one. That is a major step forward. It will increase efficiency in professional standards and, above all, patient safety and the improvement of health care to Australians. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044318"></A>
Some of the objectives that are of particular importance here are, first of all, the protection of the public, which is achieved through ensuring suitable training and qualifications and that professional people practise in a competent and ethical manner. It will facilitate workforce mobility and the reduction of red tape to provide high-quality education and training and rigorous and responsible assessments of overseas trained practitioners. It is important that we have a system that is flexible and open to innovation, and this is what is contemplated by this legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1044319"></A>
I did bring to the attention of the minister’s office concerns raised by an organisational psychologist in Toowoomba. His concern is that his branch of the psychologist profession may be overlooked, swallowed up or not catered for properly in this whole restructure. I have been told--and I will it convey it to him and other organisational psychologists if they inquire--that there is a discussion paper out there and they will have an opportunity to explain their concerns fully. I would hope that their concerns will be taken on board by the appropriate authority. I will certainly make sure the minister’s office is supplied with the detail of submissions that have been given to me, which would be the more appropriate way to deal with them on this occasion. I commend the bills and the minister. </Hansard-Body>

Ms GRACE </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Brisbane Central--ALP) (3.20 pm): I rise to make a short contribution to this cognate debate. In particular, I would like to refer to a number of areas in which I have an interest. Health is such an important issue for all of us here in this House. It is an important issue for our families, for ourselves and for the general public. Consequently, we are spending $9 billion on health this financial year and just a decade ago we were spending about $3 billion. The amount of money that goes into this very important human rights issue is incredible, and I see the right to quality health as being a human right.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1047307"></A>
I see these bills not only delivering the services for people who are not well but also looking at the broader issues of prevention, protection and regulation. Looking at prevention, I applaud this bill that includes banning smoking in motor vehicles with children under the age of 16. It is quite remarkable to think that some people actually do light up in such a small environment as a car with children riding in it. I applaud any measure that prevents children suffering from involuntarily being exposed to very high levels of tobacco smoke in what we know are confined spaces. It is definitely a move in the right direction to ban such practices from occurring. In order to undertake cultural change as we did with the wearing of seatbelts, unfortunately we have to legislate it, educate the public and then police it. I very much welcome this provision in what I call a very important prevention part of the government’s bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047309"></A>
In relation to the second part about protecting the public, I also welcome mandatory reporting of misconduct of doctors. I think it is important that we introduce measures to protect the public against professional misconduct of medical practitioners. Mandatory reporting is one way, once again, that we can achieve the cultural change necessary to make sure that the public is protected when it comes to the practices of doctors. As I said, to achieve cultural change we start with legislation, we then move to education and then move to regulating and policing that particular piece of legislation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047310"></A>
I do not agree with members on the other side of the House who have said that somehow it exposes the doctors and it makes the workplace unworkable. When we are talking about cultural change, in my experience when something is mandatory and we provide a level playing field everyone knows exactly how they are required to act and it brings about a much more harmonious workplace than one where someone is intrepid or a bit worried about raising an issue or whistleblowing. They can get away in the workplace by raising areas of concern when they occur because the legislation, the employer and the law all tell them, ‘I really have to do this as much as I really do not want to do it.’ It is kind of a way of policing oneself and making sure that no-one is conducting themselves in a manner that is reportable.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047311"></A>
As we know, reportable misconduct takes in a series of actions by doctors. This bill makes it mandatory that, if these things are witnessed or if people know about them, they must report them so that prevention strategies can be put in place. I think that goes a long way to protecting the public. It will actually cover the doctors rather than cause them to complain about it because they are able to say, ‘Under the law, I have to take this action, and I am doing the right thing.’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047312"></A>
The other part of protection is exceptions to the duty of confidentiality. I applaud this move. If we can protect children by having some exceptions in place, then I think the act strikes that right balance in ensuring the protection, the safety and the wellbeing of the child and gives the director-general the ability to perform his or her functions and helps the Queensland Health lawyers effectively carry out their responsibilities. Changes to the act which enable the protection of children and the ability for us to carry out our duties properly is also very much a step in the right direction. I applaud changes to the bill along those lines.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047313"></A>
I have worked in the area of workers compensation probably all of my union life--27 years. I know this area of the law backwards. I really do applaud the minister for introducing this. There are many instances where workers receive often minor injuries in the workplace. Allowing a nurse practitioner to issue a workers compensation medical certificate is a wonderful step in the right direction. This bill gives them that ability. They are generally the first on hand. If it is an injury that does not require them to spend time in hospital--and it might be sprains, soft tissue injuries such as strains, minor fractures, wounds or lacerations that they are treating--why should the nurse practitioner not be able to issue a workers compensation certificate that merely says, ‘This injury was based on a work related injury’? The worker is then able to put in their claim quickly and effectively without the additional expenses of having to go to see doctors when, quite clearly, it is well and truly known that they have cut themselves or strained an ankle in the performance of the work they were employed to do. This is an eminently sensible step in the right direction. As I said, I applaud the minister for bringing it to this House. That provision relating to regulation is very important. I think it is one that will help injured workers greatly when they suffer minor injuries at work, which, unfortunately, occur nearly daily in workplaces.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1047314"></A>
The last area of regulation that I want to touch on is the health practitioner regulation national law. It makes eminent sense. It is extremely important for the health and wellbeing of the public to ensure that we have one national regulatory body overseeing doctors so they can cross over borders and operate anywhere in Australia. They have the same skill set; they are judged along the same lines. Having those national standards is something for which I have worked for many workers to achieve so that we do not have differing standards when workers want to move from one state to another. I really do applaud Queensland for being the host of this legislation that will create the scheme. Obviously this is a boost to public safety. We are protecting and ensuring that health practitioners are suitably trained and qualified, cutting red tape, establishing a single national register and simple registration processes, and establishing nationally consistent standards--all of those things together obviously will ensure that we have the best doctors in Australia. I support a national register. Anyone who does not really does not understand that Queensland is a small state and we need to have the best qualified doctors. These bills go a long way towards addressing that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1053873"></A>
My congratulations go to the minister and his staff for bringing these amendments forward. They go a long way to implementing prevention, protection and regulation for the public. I believe they will bring about much of the cultural change that we often need in the very important area of health. I commend the bills to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs KIERNAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Isa--ALP) (3.29 pm): I rise to speak in this cognate debate on the health bills. The Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill seeks to amend a number of areas including mandatory reporting for doctors to report on other doctor’s misconduct and introduces laws in respect of banning smoking in vehicles which are carrying children under 16. It also covers sections in relation to the Health Quality and Complaints Commission Act and confidentiality of information.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1050282"></A>
A very important area in this legislation will enable nurse practitioners to issue a workers compensation medical certificate for minor injury at a patient’s initial attendance. In 2004 the Queensland government made a commitment to amend relevant legislation to allow for full implementation of the nurse practitioner role to enable nurse practitioners to function in stand-alone roles. The aim of this initiative was to reduce the demands on the health workforce by better utilising medical resources to improve health service delivery, particularly in rural and remote areas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050283"></A>
A nurse practitioner is a registered nurse who has extensive clinical experience and who has completed a post graduate masters degree. The masters program is to function autonomously and collaboratively in an advanced and expanded clinical role. In larger centres they work side by side with doctors and other health professionals in an interdisciplinary team in many different speciality areas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050284"></A>
To be eligible for nurse practitioner endorsement, registered nurses must meet the minimum professional and competency standards outlined in the Queensland Nursing Council’s <Hansard-Italic>
Policy on the regulation of nurse practitioners in Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
. The nurse practitioner role is innovative and integral to the health workforce reform agenda in Australia and critical to outback Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050286"></A>
The nurse practitioner role includes assessment and management of clients using knowledge and skills which may include detailed health assessment and diagnosis. Each nurse practitioner’s scope of practice is highly individual and context specific. Health management protocols provide clinical guidelines for medication related practice.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050287"></A>
Back in 2005 only two nurse practitioners were employed in Queensland Health. Today there are now 84 registered nurses authorised to practice as nurse practitioners in Queensland. Of these, 54 are employed within Queensland Health positions. It is predicted that nurse practitioner positions will continue to grow over the next three years due to the government’s investment in workforce development. Queensland Health annually allocates $160,000 in scholarships to enable registered nurses to complete master level qualifications. There are currently nine of these positions existing in the Mount Isa Health Service District.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050289"></A>
Residents in my remote communities are very dependent on their local nurse. I know as resident of Dajarra for many, many years that our family was very dependent on the excellent skills of our local nurses, and I pay tribute to the many nurses who have served in that little town over the years past and present. With the increased training and responsibilities, the nurse practitioner role has certainly reduced travelling requirements for patients and in many instances--again from personal experience--there is a high degree of trust and patient satisfaction with services provided by nurse practitioners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050292"></A>
A further benefit for isolated patients were the amendments in 2004 of the Health (Drugs and Poisons) Regulation to enable nurse practitioners to prescribe controlled and restricted drugs under a protocol approved by the chief executives of Queensland Health. In 2005 amendments were also made to the Radiation Safety Regulation to enable nurse practitioners to request X-rays.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050294"></A>
Nurse practitioners are often the first point of contact with patients with work related injuries, most certainly in our rural and remote communities. They see and treat patients on a daily basis, and treatments range from sprains, strains, fractures, wounds and lacerations. Although nurse practitioners are able to provide the necessary health care for these non-complex work related injuries and illnesses, referral of these patients to a medical officer is nevertheless often required for the sole purpose of obtaining a workers compensation medical certificate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050295"></A>
The referral of a patient to a doctor only to obtain a workers compensation medical certificate for an injury such as a sprain or laceration may mean a long drive to a bigger centre or being dependent on the next RFDS clinic, which in most instances are held on a fortnightly basis. The amendments to the Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act will enable nurse practitioners to issue a workers compensation medical certificate at a patient’s initial attendance for minor injuries, if the certificate is issued under the workers compensation certificate protocol. The protocol will then set the conditions and any desirable restrictions on the issuing of such certificates.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050296"></A>
Patients requiring subsequent or continuing workers compensation medical certificates would be referred to a medical officer, as would patients initially presenting with more serious workplace injuries or illnesses. I believe every aspect of these amendments can only further the betterment of health delivery across Queensland, particularly in rural and remote Queensland. I commend the bills to the House. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WATT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Everton--ALP) (3.35 pm): I am also pleased to speak in support of these two bills. They make a number of important changes to improve the health and safety of all Queenslanders. They introduce a requirement that doctors must report professional misconduct of their colleagues and that will undoubtedly improve the safety of medical treatment that Queenslanders receive. The bills also improve complaints mechanisms for users of the health system and they usher in an important reform which will involve the granting to nurse practitioners the power to issue a workers compensation medical certificate for a minor injury. As the member for Mount Isa just illustrated, that is a particularly important reform to ensure that we meet the growing demands for health services that we see in Queensland and to ensure that we use our highly qualified nurses to perform to the maximum of their ability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050300"></A>
There are two aspects of the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill that I would like to focus on in my remarks. The first is the amendments relating to smoking. As the House is aware, recently my title was changed to the Parliamentary Secretary for Healthy Living. That was a reflection of the government’s commitment to ensuring that Queenslanders live longer and healthier lives and to reducing the burden of lifestyle diseases on the health system. That is why we have a target in our Toward Q2 document to cut by one-third some of the primary causes of chronic diseases including obesity and overweightness, physical inactivity--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050302"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Interjected>
Mrs Keech</Hansard-Member-Interjected>
 interjected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050303"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 It has just been pointed out to me that ‘overweightness’ may not be a word. It is a very overweight word, a long word. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050304"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Lucas:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Germans do that. They have these massive big nouns.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050306"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WATT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The Minister for Health would not know anything about that topic--German sausages, I mean. One of the important dimensions of that target is to reduce by one-third the proportion of Queenslanders who are smokers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050307"></A>
Queensland has led the nation already in combating the harmful effects of smoking under the Bligh government and before it the Beattie government. In 1998 we introduced new laws which banned the supply of tobacco products to children under 18 years. In 2002 we increased the penalties for the supply of tobacco products to children and introduced new restrictions on advertising, display and promotion of tobacco products. In 2004 we introduced new laws restricting where smoking could occur--so now there is no smoking permitted inside pubs, clubs, restaurants and workplaces, outdoor eating or drinking areas, within 10 metres of children’s playground equipment, at major sports stadiums and within four metres of non-residential building entrances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050309"></A>
I have to say as a nonsmoker that it makes all of those places much more pleasant environments to be in but, more importantly, those measures are having a fantastic effect by driving down the percentage of Queenslanders who smoke--from 19.8 per cent in 2004 to 16 per cent in 2008-09. Unfortunately the statistics to do with risk factors for chronic disease are going the other way. We have more Queenslanders who are overweight or obese. We have more Queenslanders who are drinking to harmful levels. So it is really pleasing that at least in one area--that is, smoking--the percentages are going down. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050340"></A>
Between 2004 and 2007 there was a reduction of more than 10 per cent in the number of Queensland women aged 20 to 29 who smoke. For young Queenslanders aged 14 to 19 years, there has been a 2.3 per cent reduction since 2004. That is obviously very important, because we want to make sure that young Queenslanders do not get hooked on this addictive substance at an early age, so I am very pleased to see that the proportion of young people smoking is also falling.</Hansard-Body>
<DIV>
<IMAGE xml:link="simple" href="2009_10_29_DAILY-30.gif" show="embed" actuate="auto"/>
</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050341"></A>
Despite this good news, there is definitely more to do. Each year, 3,400 Queenslanders die as a result of smoking. Smoking is responsible for about 80 per cent of all lung cancer deaths and 20 per cent of all cancer deaths in Queensland. Smoking is costing our health system $217 million annually through smoking related hospital admissions and other healthcare needs. That is why the Queensland government is seeking to further strengthen the state’s already tough antismoking regime. It will help us meet our Q2 target. It will save taxpayers’ money by reducing the burden on the health system. More than anything, it will to keep Queenslanders alive. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050342"></A>
This bill represents the next step in the Bligh government’s strong moves to restrict smoking. It will ban smoking in vehicles carrying children under 16 years of age. It will grant local councils the power to regulate smoking in outdoor pedestrian malls and at public transport waiting points. It will add to the current restrictions on the promotion and display of cigarettes by restricting the promotion of smoking related products. These are all great steps that will reduce the number of Queenslanders who smoke, helping them to live longer and healthier lives and reducing the cost of smoking on the entire community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050343"></A>
The other aspect of this bill that I want to briefly touch on concerns health practitioner regulation. The bill will usher in a national scheme to regulate and register health professionals for the very first time. It will improve patient safety by ensuring that only health professionals who are suitably trained and qualified can practise in Queensland. Rather than each state having its own registration requirements--some of them set a high standard and some of them set a low standard--we will now have a uniform set of requirements to be registered as a health practitioner in each state of Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050344"></A>
I have received some representations from constituents on this aspect of the bill. I have raised these issues with the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health already, but I would appreciate it if he could address them in his remarks as well. The first set of constituents I have heard from are psychologists. They have two concerns. One is what they consider to be the absence of restrictions on who can conduct certain psychological tests. Currently, these tests can only be conducted by someone with psychological training, but my constituents argue that the bill will open the conduct of these tests to unqualified people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050346"></A>
They also argue that the bill will restrict the ranks of who may gain general registration as a psychologist. It will restrict the ability to those people who hold particular higher qualifications. My constituents are concerned that this will restrict psychologists who have practised for many years from performing a very wide range of psychological work. I would appreciate it if the Deputy Premier could respond to those issues in his remarks. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050347"></A>
The other constituent I heard from is a speech pathologist. She has a concern, as does her association, that at the moment her profession will not be included in the national registration and accreditation scheme. I understand that is something that Queensland actually sought to achieve and it may still be on the agenda, but I would appreciate it if the Deputy Premier could provide my constituent with some advice about proposals to ensure that speech pathologists will be registered nationally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050348"></A>
With those words, I will sum up by commending the minister, his staff and his department for their good work on these bills. They will undoubtedly make a great contribution to improving the health and wellbeing of Queenslanders. I commend the bills to the House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050350"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr WELLINGTON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nicklin--Ind) (3.42 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill 2009. There are two issues that I wish to briefly touch on, as I know the minister is ready to respond to the matters that have already been raised. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050351"></A>
I am very pleased that the government is going down the road of having a national registration and accreditation scheme for health professionals in Australia. No longer is Queensland isolated. Often we see teachers, nurses, doctors, staff and just people easily and frequently change their residence and employment from one state or territory to another. I think it is very important that so much of our legislation in Australia and Queensland today is built around a national focus. I believe the trend will be for more legislation to have a national focus so that it does not matter whether you are in Queensland or Western Australia because the same rules will apply. I congratulate the minister. It is a great move and I certainly support that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050352"></A>
The other issue I want to touch on, which I know other members have already raised, is the proposed amendments which will enable nurse practitioners to have a range of new roles, such as issuing workers compensation medical certificates and other duties. I believe this is a forward step and it is the way that other professions will go. We certainly need to be able to extend the powers of many of our very competent staff in our nursing profession, and I believe this is a great move. It will empower our nurses and give them a real opportunity to progress, but, more importantly, it will give them some responsibility which I know they are certainly capable of handling.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050353"></A>
I commend the bill to the House. I know that other issues have been raised in detail by both government and opposition members. I look forward to this matter proceeding to the consideration in detail stage. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050355"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. PT LUCAS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health) (3.44 pm), in reply: I thank members of the House for their contributions to the cognate debate on the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill and the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill. The Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill represents an important step towards improving Australia’s health system through the national registration and accreditation of health practitioners. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050356"></A>
The Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill will improve the consistency of the health practitioner registration acts and the Nursing Act with medical registration. Medical registration in Queensland was one of the templates used to develop the national law, and therefore these amendments will in the main improve the consistency of Queensland’s registration scheme with the national registration scheme and provide for smoother transition to the national scheme. We have learned from a number of experiences in this state that put us at the forefront of arguing for national legislation. We understand the problems when people go from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050357"></A>
In addition, the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill contains a significant number of amendments in relation to smoking laws, duty of confidentiality, contact tracing for contagious conditions and consultation requirements for the development of health quality and complaints standards which further build on the government’s positive record of continuous reform of the health system. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050358"></A>
The health and wellbeing of the public is of paramount concern to this government. I believe that national consistency in registration and accreditation arrangements for health practitioners will help to improve the accountability and flexibility of the provision of health services and also protect the public, by using the highest possible registration and accreditation standards nationwide, from potentially harmful health outcomes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050359"></A>
The national scheme for the health professions agreed to by COAG will promote consistency in decision making by moving from the current fragmented jurisdictional system to one national scheme. This scheme will deliver improved administrative efficiency in that health practitioners will need to be registered only once in order to practise in more than one Australian jurisdiction. Consequently, it will promote a more flexible, responsible and sustainable health workforce. A number of members have raised issues about the red tape that people have to go through from state to state and each level of government. This goes part of the way to eliminating that. I concede that we still have further to go. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050361"></A>
The national scheme is also expected to provide improved safeguards for the public. National publicly accessible registers for health practitioners will go a long way to avoiding the unfortunate situations we have seen in the past where a board in one state or territory has registered a practitioner unaware that he or she has been the subject of an investigation in another jurisdiction. It is clearly not in the best interests of the people of Queensland for the current fragmented system of regulation to continue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050362"></A>
The practical reality is that our health workforce is already highly mobile and will become increasingly more so in the future. To be able to support and maintain the dynamic high-quality workforce required to meet the health needs of Queenslanders and Australians, it is clearly necessary for all jurisdictions to cooperate in developing a nationally consistent regulatory system. Rather than Queensland relinquishing its authority in relation to the registration and accreditation of health practitioners, this cooperative approach allows Queensland to play an active and leading role in shaping the integrated cross-jurisdictional scheme best able to provide positive health outcomes for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050363"></A>
Many of the comments from speakers in this debate have been about detailed matters. I will address most of those in detail in the committee stage if people raise those issues there, but I would like to address some of the more significant issues raised. The member for Caloundra has expressed concern about parliamentary scrutiny of the scheme in this legislation. The national scheme for health professions cannot become fully operational in all states and territories until all of the parliaments have had an opportunity to debate legislation that proposes to adopt and apply the national law as a law of each participating jurisdiction--that is, bill C. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050364"></A>
Introducing a national law in one parliament for adoption by other states is a standard approach for achieving national scheme legislation in areas where the constitutional powers lie with states and territories. Nothing any minister is doing can bind their parliament. Each parliament, including ours, will decide for itself when debating its jurisdiction’s legislation whether to adopt and apply the national law as a law of its jurisdiction. We need to remember, though, that we cannot have everything we want, because not every state can always get everything it wants. I would rather have speech pathologists as part of national registration--I will continue to pursue that--but clearly we need to make some compromises when we have a national scheme.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050365"></A>
I and my ministerial council colleagues have a clear and unwavering commitment to consultation. This has been demonstrated in the consultation that has happened in the legislation before us today. If there are significant changes proposed in the future, members of the House, the public and the professions can feel confident that there will be national consultation prior to them being put forward for agreement. I note that both sides of the House acknowledge there have been changes as consultation has taken place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050406"></A>
For the information of the member for Moggill, I confirm that the scheme will operate from 1 July 2010, and that is a tight time frame. A number of other parliaments have also introduced their adopting legislation, I think in both Victoria and New South Wales at this stage. Looking at progress to date, I anticipate all preparatory work will be completed and the timetable can be met. Governments have contributed $19.8 million to the cost of transition to the national scheme as well as an additional provision above that level in order to fully cover all IT costs to 30 June 2010. That will assist the national agency and boards and other key features of the scheme to commence well in advance of the 1 July 2010 commencement date and ensure that a smooth transition occurs.</Hansard-Body>
<DIV>
<IMAGE xml:link="simple" href="2009_10_29_DAILY-31.gif" show="embed" actuate="auto"/>
</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050407"></A>
In order to retain the vast body of knowledge in current state and territory boards and their staff, ministers have agreed to both a staffing strategy to transition as many existing staff to the national agency as appropriate and to provide for the transition of many current board members from state and territory boards to the national boards where they will exist. I am sure I speak on behalf of the ministerial council when I say that I welcome the opportunity to be part of implementing a national scheme that will provide for the protection of the public by ensuring that only those health practitioners who are suitably trained and qualified to practise are registered. This underpins the safety and quality of our health scheme.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050408"></A>
The development of the national scheme has enabled ministers to adopt the strongest elements of all jurisdictions which will come together for the first time ever in a consistent set of national standards and processes for registration and accreditation for health professionals. The national scheme will also help reduce red tape for registrants, especially when they work across or move between different states and territories--another important reform to improve workforce development and mobility.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050409"></A>
I turn now to other contributions from members. The mandatory reporting provisions will apply to all registered medical practitioners in Queensland. Medical practitioners in Queensland have an ethical obligation to report professional misconduct. The amendments for medical practitioners entrench these obligations into legislation. We will talk about that more in the consideration in detail stage, as we similarly will the smoking issues. I note that the member for Caloundra is proposing amendments that will seek to extend that further. I am confused about that because the member for Dalrymple said he believed these were essentially interferences and impossible to enforce. It will be interesting to see how he votes on it. Presumably he will oppose the opposition’s amendment and then seek to divide on the government’s clause, but we will see about that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050411"></A>
I turn to the Health Quality and Complaints Commission issues. In November 2007 the select committee appointed by this House delivered its report on the review of the commission after its first year of operation. The select committee made 37 recommendations for improving the commission’s operation, all of which were accepted by the government either in principle or without reservation. The bill delivers on recommendations 20 and 36 by requiring the HQCC in developing or amending standards to properly consult with affected parties and the public through an impact assessment process. Developing and maintaining those standards is an important part of the work of the commission, enabling it to promote continuous quality improvement in public and private health facilities. However, this process is not as it should be as it is not done in a practical, consultative fashion. This amendment seeks to get the balance right, but, as I say, we will have a look at that in the course of time and if we need to further finetune that we will.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050413"></A>
As our population ages and our rates of chronic disease increase, pressures on our health system will continue. In the June quarter this year, over 378,000 people were treated in emergency departments throughout Queensland--an increase of almost 6,000 compared to the same period last year. More than 220,000 were admitted to hospital--an increase of over 11,000--and over 851,000 received outpatient services--an increase of almost 10,000. That is why the government continues to aggressively grow the health workforce as part of our $10 billion Health Action Plan, employing more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050415"></A>
I want to make this clear, because it was raised by a number of people. Since June 2005 we have employed an additional 2,109 doctors--an increase of 46 per cent. Over the same period we have employed an additional 7,733 nurses--an increase of 35 per cent--and 2,802 allied health professionals--an increase of 40 per cent. This bill makes a number of amendments to better support our health workforce and enable the valuable skills of our doctors, nurses and allied health professionals to be used as effectively as possible. It amends 13 health practitioner registration acts in essentially the same way with two exceptions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050417"></A>
The bill includes amendments to the Health Services Act in relation to the exceptions to the duty of confidentiality. The members for Glass House and Burleigh touched on the need for flexibility in the protection of patient records to ensure the appropriate support and care can be given to family members outside the health system. I indicated before that these amendments are about doing that. I intend to take this further, though. On a number of occasions when I have spoken to health professionals, families and mental health professionals they have said, ‘How does it help someone if you do not appropriately share information with their families or doctors or care givers? They go out into the community, get sick, people are not aware of their issues and they end up back in an institution.’ That is not in anyone’s interests. Sometimes I think people in the public sector get a bit obsessed about who the balance of privacy is for the benefit of. We will make sure we continue to look at that issue. I thank the honourable members for that.</Hansard-Body>

I propose to amend the provisions in clause 61 of the bill for mandatory reporting for doctors to ensure that the reporting obligation under the bill is as far as possible consistent with the reporting obligations for health professionals in the national bill. What is in the national bill I will be amending the state bill to do. It is ridiculous to have a six-month period where it is different. I should say this to the honourable member, too. He wants to move an amendment, but he will not be seeking to amend the national bill. Maybe he will seek to do that. That is a bit different if he does. We do need some uniformity in relation to that.</Hansard-Body>

The member for Caloundra sought clarification about clause 2(1), which provides for retrospective application of the amendments being made to the research provisions of the Public Health Act. The amendments were put forward in light of advice provided by crown law in relation to operational issues identified by the department following the commencement of the research provisions on 16 January 2006. In particular, it was identified during rollout of new provisions that confusion surrounded which provisions should be used to release information, as the release of confidential information is covered in various health portfolio acts. Clause 163 inserts new provision 280A to clarify that research provisions under the Public Health Act do not prevent health information.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050423"></A>
It is very important to encourage research into these things. We saw a little while ago that the Cancer Council Queensland had a number of issues that the government needed to address with respect to information we possessed in Queensland Health and its ability to access it so it could perform appropriate health research. That is a very important issue that confronts us.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050425"></A>
Clause 165(2) amends section 284 to clarify that, when making a decision about whether a person should be granted access to information for research purposes, the chief executive is not required to consult with an individual to whom the information relates before granting an application. Crown law advice suggests that a decision to grant access for research purposes to potentially identifying health information held by Queensland Health is subject to the requirements of natural justice, and this would require the chief executive to notify each person to whom the information relates and to give them an opportunity to respond. That would not be in the best interests of medical research. The reason that people are getting better is that we have better treatments. The reason we have better treatments is that people undertake medical research. It is critical.</Hansard-Body>

There was some discussion by the member for Gaven about mandatory reporting and his concerns with respect to it. There are matters that I cannot talk about in this chamber because they are before the courts, but I would have thought they would be absolutely adequate rolled gold examples of where mandatory reporting is important. Indeed, the suggestion was made by that member and I think the member for Burnett that in a number of instances people made reports to people who were in management, and clearly those people did not act on them. A commission of inquiry found that. This will make that mandatory reporting to the national board. Indeed, entities that do not pass on their concerns about that issue are then subject to sanction as well, and the member for Moggill raised an issue with that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050427"></A>
The member for Currumbin shared with the member for Burnett in giving probably the most disgraceful performance in the debate. There are members on both sides of the House who make really good contributions and others who do not. There have been some excellent contributions from both sides of the House. The member for Burnett demonstrated why he went off the front bench, and the member for Currumbin demonstrates why she will go off the front bench in due course, because there are certainly people on her own back bench who performed in this debate substantially better than she did. But it is good to see good contributions from members of both sides. To suggest, as she did, that there is not a real role for nurse practitioners is quite disappointing and takes away the fact that the backbone of our health system is our nurses. They are our major employees. They are doing a wonderful job, as all of our health professionals are.</Hansard-Body>

The member for Glass House gave what I thought was a very good contribution. He spoke about other allied health professions and the issue of speech pathologists. The member for Bulimba, a speech pathologist herself, also raised that issue, as did the member for Everton. One of my colleagues said to me while the member for Bulimba was making her contribution that we do not seem to see as many people these days with really bad stammers. I suspect the reason is that we have people like speech pathologists and speech therapists who are providing support to young kids. It is a very important thing. The reason we have national registration is to protect people. A parent or someone who has had a stroke wants to know that the health professional, for example the speech pathologist, who is treating them has professional standing and competency behind them. That is why we would like to see that national registration. What we will need to do for speech pathologists and dental technicians is work out an alternative. My concern is that I do not want to have a big separate bureaucracy for them because that will then impact on their cost to practise. We will need to have a look at what models are potentially available for them that do not throw the baby out with the bath water.</Hansard-Body>

The member for Kawana, in another very ordinary contribution, raised issues such as mandatory misconduct reporting. He related a tragic case of someone committing suicide because he indicated that that person was concerned about reporting. The first thing that anyone should learn when they come into this House is that anecdotal, unidentified arguments are impossible to rebut. They are the result of someone who is not very good at being a parliamentarian. Having said that, the case referred to in that anecdote happened under a different system. We need to be serious about this. There is a choice we have here. Sure, there are concerns about mandatory reporting, but the alternative is that people slip through the cracks and patients get injured or killed. That is why we have mandatory reporting.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I do know what a DC-10 is. Many years ago the aviation industry adopted what it calls crew resource management. What crew resource management means in aeroplanes is that everybody who is part of the team has an equal say and role. So if a flight attendant looks out the window and sees something wrong with the flap, the wing or the engine, that person can go up to the captain and say, ‘I have a concern about this,’ and they will not get abused and treated as a fool. It is fair to say that other professions, in particular the medical profession, have taken a while to actually come to the realisation that that is a clear aspect of safety. We all know the stories about the bad old days where other allied health staff and nurses were subject to ‘How dare you ever question me?’ and that sort of thing. I am delighted to say that that is not what I have observed at all in our Queensland Health facilities. We have people who are very enlightened on all parts of the profession. Let us be realistic about it, because we need to be able to deal with these issues.</Hansard-Body>

The member for Maryborough asked about ATSI health practitioners. One of the critical issues we have with chronic health problems with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is not so much the issue of their medical treatment by doctors or nurses or the like but that the people who are providing ongoing support and education in the community are predominantly people from their own communities. They are much better off when they have someone from their own community doing that. When I was in Palm Island a little while ago I was delighted to see Dr Ray. Dr Ray is a Palm Island boy through and through. He was born on Palm Island and is now a doctor. It makes me so proud when I see him working alongside our other doctors.</Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 He exists on a different plane. And I know about planes, as I said before, but he is on a different plane. He said that he was concerned about nurse practitioners because they will take nurses away from working on the shop floor, so to speak, of hospitals. That is exactly what nurse practitioners are for. He did not understand or listen both in question time this morning or during this debate. The problem in the past for nurses was that if they wanted to go up the career structure they had to become an administrator. This allows nurses to be clinicians at more and more senior levels for not only their own professional development but also the benefit of society. It is very sad that he does not understand that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068962"></A>
The member for Dalrymple, as I said before, mentioned the nanny state when it comes to the tobacco amendments. I am looking forward to seeing how he is going to vote on that. He talked about the difficulty of getting doctors and nurses in rural places. Nurse practitioners are part of doing that, and a substantial increase in training numbers in our medical schools and universities so that we have more and more doctors, nurses and allied health professional is also an important part of that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068963"></A>
The member for Burnett failed to understand that the complaints process in the national law provides for complaints to an independent national body. He also, when he talked about funding, neglected to point out that under the Howard government the federal share of hospital funding went from 50 per cent to 34 per cent. That is a disgrace. It did not match the growth in state funding for health. He never said anything about that. I suppose the problem is that when one has no capacity to construct a contribution to a debate one reads slabs of text from royal commissions rather than contribute to the meaningful debate. Just about everybody else in this place--some views I agreed with and some views I did not agree with--at least had the capacity to discuss the issues.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1068964"></A>
The member for Gregory, in another very good contribution, talked about doctors from overseas countries. This is one of the issues that people like the member for Currumbin would never agree takes place. I do not accept that leaving who decides who becomes registered as a professional is something that only a professional organisation should have a say in. We have known the issues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068965"></A>
The member for Waterford, in an excellent contribution, talked about the old days of restrictive work practices in some areas industrially. We need to constantly be on guard to make sure that some people just do not want to protect their turf. Multiskilling, whether that be on the shop floor of a factory or in the health system, is the way of the future. We will continue to work to encourage that.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068966"></A>
Doctors from overseas countries are a case in point. I remember many years ago I had a constituent who was a physiotherapy graduate from the university of Leiden--one of the great European continental universities. She lectured in physiotherapy in a British hospital and she could not get automatic registration in Queensland. Apparently we are so good that we are better than everyone in Europe. That is ridiculous. We have to be serious in looking at how we accept qualifications from comparable overseas countries.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068968"></A>
The member for Gregory spoke about red tape, as did the member for Moggill. As I said, that is an important issue that we will need to continue to address. The member for Gregory spoke about Blackwater and the growth in services there and in other communities such as Alpha which will grow with the Galilee Basin and the like.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068970"></A>
We need to be very clear about what we do in health in rural and regional Queensland. We need to take the opportunity to adjust what we are doing to take into account population growth, and indeed some places will decline. We need to frankly address what we are doing so we can have sustainability. The greatest problem that we have had in the past is when governments have said that they will stick a service into somewhere with one practitioner and that practitioner leaves or goes and does something else and we have a whole bureaucracy set up and everyone is inconvenienced because we have not got a person there to support that service when the other person leaves.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068971"></A>
In the future I think more and more we will try to have practitioners in groups. Surely it is better to have two doctors who can relieve and support each other in a community with a larger area of coverage than one or two individual nodes where they cannot support each other all of the time and they burn out. Doctors in regional Queensland have said to me the issue is not so much what they are paid. Doctors in Queensland are pretty well paid compared to those in other states; in remote and regional areas they get paid more. If we said that we would give them another $20,000 a year to be specialist X but they will be the only one there and they will never get any relief, they would say, ‘Great! Send that $20,000 to the family solicitor to pay for my divorce, because my partner will leave me because I will have burned out.’ That is a critical issue.</Hansard-Body>

 My shadow colleague is a legal practitioner, as I am. One of the real problems as a legal practitioner is those who work in sole practice.

<A ID="pgfId-1068974"></A>
The member for Gregory talked about obstetrics. We want to roll out and improve the midwife model of care at more and more locations, and I know the member for Beaudesert has raised that issue as well. However, we also need to understand that one of the reasons that we have the third longest life expectancy on earth and one of the reasons we have better outcomes from our hospitals and our health system is that we are frankly assessing what we can do appropriately and safely in communities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068975"></A>
We need to have a hub-and-spoke model in Queensland. The hub and spoke does not just apply in South-East Queensland; we have to have base hospitals as well. If Townsville, Cairns, Rockhampton, Toowoomba and Mount Isa are appropriate hubs for their spokes, they can then work with each other. They are hubs and spokes for various different wheels.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1068977"></A>
The member for Toowoomba South spoke about speech pathology as well, businesses cases, funding and the like. It is important to do business cases. I think the member for Burnett spoke about budgets and how there is some heresy if health practitioners or administrators are held to account for budgets. Of course they should be held accountable for their budgets, because if you have a system and you do not keep to your budget you are taking money off the people who are doing the right thing. It is not unreasonable to expect accountability from people and for them to work within the budget that they are given. Sure, we can have arguments about what those budgets might be, but it is very important that we say, ‘Okay, here is a budget. We will work within that framework.’</Hansard-Body>

The member for Toowoomba North spoke about smoking, and I will just give members this anecdote. Last week I was on holidays in Victoria. Melbourne is a lovely place. It has a light rail system. Obviously, according to the Leader of the Opposition, that has ruined Melbourne. Having said that, do members want to know what I found absolutely abhorrent about Melbourne? When you go to Lygon Street in Carlton people are smoking like chimneys at restaurants out in the open. It really struck me that a city that portrays itself as being world class--and it is in so many areas--is light years behind us in terms of smoking in public. Melbourne has a light rail system that we would like to have on the Gold Coast, but in terms of smoking it has yet to come to grips with the fact that it needs to take the issue of smoking in public places seriously. It is a long, long way behind. People in Queensland would never put up with the sort of smoking that is happening in places like Melbourne. I commend the bills to the House.</Hansard-Body>

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Up>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069031"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The advice from my department is as I indicated before. For example, there are certain provisions under the Public Health Act that allow research to take place and then there are privacy implications in relation to those provisions. Then there is a question as to how they then interact with the provisions of the other health acts. It was important to clarify that. The date of January 2006 was selected only because that was when those provisions were originally enacted. That is what I am advised. </Hansard-Body>

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (4.13 pm): This clause is replicated throughout the bill. It inserts ‘12 months’ in lieu of ‘6 months’ for registration purposes. Could the minister outline why the change has occurred? Is there a particular set of circumstances that warrants that change? I understand from the briefing we had some time ago that it may relate to James Cook University or some sort of qualification process within a university. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069037"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member. I am advised that some universities do not hold graduation ceremonies until June or July in the year after a student finishes the course. If a student gains provisional registration in December, the six-month period expires before the university can confer or provide its degree certificate. That means that the provisional registrant will have to reapply and pay the required fee again. This amendment will overcome that problem. That is what I am advised. The provision of the governing act will be repealed upon commencement of the national scheme. So it is operating only for the interim period. </Hansard-Body>

Clause 31--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069042"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (4.14 pm): This clause relates to the alteration of the term ‘within 14 days of’ to the phrase ‘as soon as practicable after’. My concern about this clause is that section 55 as it stood--this clause amends that section--had a definitive time line in relation to the expiration of the issue dealt with by the relevant body. When you open up the wording, you then potentially leave open how long a body can deal with a matter. I seek clarification at this point as to why ‘within 14 days of’ has been changed to what appears in clause 31, because it tends to raise some concern about when the matter can be determined. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069044"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. First of all, in terms of why there has been a change from the period of 14 days, section 55 of the Health Practitioners (Professional Standards) Act requires that when a board rejects a complaint it must give written notice of its decision and its reasons to the relevant parties within 14 days after making the decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069047"></A>
The practice of the Queensland health practitioners board is that when a decision to reject a complaint is made by the board at its meeting the decision and reasons are recorded in draft minutes of the meeting which are then ratified by the board at its next meeting. That ensures the written notice of the decision will accurately reflect the board’s decision. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069049"></A>
While the Medical Board meets fortnightly, the majority of other boards meet only monthly. That means that the boards that meet monthly or less frequently cannot comply with the 14-day time frame for giving notice of decisions under section 55. By allowing boards to give notice of their decision as soon as practicable after it is made, the amendment recognises that the boards’ recording of decisions affects the time frames within which boards are able to give notice of their decisions. I am confident that the boards will act responsibly.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069050"></A>
I am told that under the national law--and this clause refers to rejecting complaints--there is no time limit for providing the notification. It is ‘as soon as practicable’. Not everything that is in our legislation is the same as the national legislation because, frankly, it is not worth changing some of it. But in the process of changing it, it is trying to make it uniform. This provision is uniform. I think there are some other provisions that are not. Again, frankly, this provision will apply only for the next seven months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069051"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the minister for that. I take the point that he raised. I know that the national law has wording similar to what is contained in this amendment. My concern is that the use of the phrase is open-ended. We are both legal practitioners and we know how that can at times lead to difficulties and concerns. Is there some method whereby the time can be linked to, if not the date of the next board meeting, some point in time of 14 days after the decision is made as opposed to ‘as soon as practicable’? That can be any length of time. I am concerned about the confusion that can arise in people’s minds. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069052"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The honourable member raises reasonable concerns. We probably come from a background where we like the certainty of time limits and time frames. Having said that, I would not propose to change Queensland law at this point, but I am more than happy to at least address the issue of procedures that might take place at those boards with my national colleagues through the appropriate workings. I will feed the member’s concerns about that into the system. You do not want to have a situation where people get more obsessed with their internal activities and mechanisms than, frankly, their right to be notified as to whether they are successful or unsuccessful. So I will feed the member’s concern into the national system. I cannot undertake to change it, but in terms of what they are doing they need to have appropriate procedures. The member for Moggill talked about time limits and red tape before. It is not an unreasonable point. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069085"></A>
Amendment No. 1 amends clause 42 of the bill which amends section 392 of the Health Practitioners (Professional Standards) Act to allow confidential information obtained under that act to be disclosed to the Queensland Nursing Council and the Nursing Tribunal if the disclosure is necessary to allow those bodies to perform their functions under Nursing Act. However, with effect from 1 December 2009 the Nursing Tribunal will be replaced by the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal, created under the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act, QCAT. Therefore, there is no need to authorise disclosure of confidential information to the Nursing Tribunal from that time as QCAT will be a disciplinary body. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Up>
<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(4.22 pm): This clause relates to the amendment allowing standards to be made and an amendment to those standards to occur as a consequence of the HQCC Select Committee inquiry. The amendment to clause 46 provides a significant range of matters that must be dealt with before the standard can become operative, including consultation, publication on the website et cetera. A couple of points arise. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069097"></A>
First of all, when one considers the terms of clause 46 it would appear that it does not define who the consultation is to be with. It does not indicate whether it is to be with a college or an education facility. Who decides who the consultation will be with? It also would appear that the commission must publish on its website for at least 14 days a copy of the impact assessment statement and a notice inviting anyone to comment upon the content of the document. That would imply that the consultation follows the proposal being garnered by the governmental body. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069098"></A>
At proposed subsection (8) it states that failure to comply with the section does not affect the validity of the standard or amendment. When one takes into account the importance of the standards and the processes put in place within the terms of clause 46, one gets the idea that we are going to achieve, by way of consultation--one way or another--publication et cetera, a standard or an amendment that will achieve something. We then find that, even if that is not undertaken under proposed subsection (8), the standard or the amendment is still valid. If we are going to have a process put in place that allows consultation, input and scrutiny by various organisations and bodies, why, then, does the minister say that one can not do all of that but still have a valid document, a valid standard or a valid amendment? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069099"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The honourable member would well know the difference between mandatory and directory provisions. Having directory provisions in legislation is not uncommon. These are those. I would also point out that it is my understanding that these standards are, in fact, not binding. They are guidelines for what good and appropriate practice is. The fact that they are still validly made standards is not in that sense the be-all and end-all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069100"></A>
In terms of the time involved in these sorts of things, the HQCC has advised that new or amended standards only occur through a full review. The first full review of the HQCC’s seven healthcare standards, introduced on 1 July 2007, commenced on 1 August 2009. It is an 18-month process, due for completion in 2010. The review involves consultation through an open submission process and the advice of clinical expert reference groups. These groups are made up of stakeholders from professional colleges and representatives from public and private healthcare facilities. Group members are selected through an expression-of-interest process and are credible, influential and valued members. Following the full review of the standards and development of an impact assessment statement, the HQCC will undertake a communication and education campaign. I could go on a bit longer about that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069101"></A>
The honourable member asked: what is the point of consulting after one has the standard? That is not uncommon. I think there are a number of state planning policies that are a bit like that, where one goes through a whole lot of processes. First of all they formulate that they might want to have a standard and then say, ‘We are thinking of having a standard. What do you think about what we should do in it?’ Then they say, ‘Okay, we will have a big think about it. This is what we think it should be. What do you think about it?’ Then one is adopted in the end.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069102"></A>
Provisions are becoming more complex because they have to outline everything--for example, ‘Before you go to work you put the key in the ignition of the car, turn it to the right, close the door, put the seatbelt on,’ rather than say, ‘Look, you just drive to work,’ and assume that people do what they should do along the way. I suppose we could be more prescriptive in relation to these standards. The Health Quality and Complaints Commission does an excellent job, but I want to look at whether there might be some things that we can streamline. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069103"></A>
I know that we have had concerns that when reports have been provided, due to the confidential nature of them, there have been difficulties about providing information to the public about their outcomes in other areas. That does not relate to this. I am keen to look more broadly at the HQCC process so that we can get the best of both worlds. I will look at this further. I can give the member the sorts of standards that we have. They have indicated to me that they do undertake quite an extensive process when it comes to that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069104"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take on board the comments that the minister has made. It would appear, though, that when one makes a comparison about this with the national law bill there is a distinction between the two. In the national law bill there does seem to be more of an emphasis on full and frank consultation prior to anything being prepared. It just seems to me that there is an inconsistency in the two pieces of legislation. We will come to the second one down the track. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069105"></A>
My concern is that if we are going to have a standard and if there is going to be consultation, the consultation needs to be in a manner that is with the appropriate bodies. I think that is compulsory in the theme of getting a health system across the nation that deals with the concerns of all Queenslanders and all Australians on the ground. I have great difficulty in understanding how we can have a process in place but then say that a body that in six to eight months time will be part of the national scheme can avoid that process now. If we are going to do it, do it right now because the national law will require that we do it in a different manner.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069131"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The honourable member has extended the issue of the national scheme a little bit further. It will work with the national law, but it will be stand-alone. The HQCC will be recognised in the national law, but it will continue to exist in Queensland law. It is not like the medical boards and things like that, which will be national bodies under different legislation. National standards can result in prosecution and/or cancellation or suspension. HQCC standards result in referral to an investigative body. So they have a different role. </Hansard-Body>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069134"></A>
As I said to the member--not because it relates to the national scheme so much. The HQCC is looking more at institutional issues. If a doctor, nurse or whoever has undertaken an act that is dangerous or wrong, that is a matter for the professional board. If there is a concern about how a private or public hospital has operated in relation to a matter more generally, that is more a HQCC thing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069135"></A>
As I said before, in the context of working with the HQCC, I am happy to have a look at where we need to go in the future and those sorts of things to take the honourable member’s point, which was a point legitimately and validly made, on board. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (4.39 pm): This particular clause comes as a result of the report into the very sad death of that young girl from Bribie Island. A number of concerns were raised within the report, in particular, whether a number of matters have been referred to the health department relating to concerns involving young children, their parents and mental illnesses. Proposed new section 62IA states that disclosure can be to a person. The minister and I both know that can be other people as well, not just one person. The report specifically deals with a report being made to a health organisation or a support group--and I want to make this very clear here. The use of the term ‘person’ in what will be the section is not going to be confined to a parent or a grandparent. If there is say, for example, a support group assisting a child and the parent has a mental illness, that support group can be contacted although they are not relatives. There are certainly circumstances in today’s society where that does happen. I want to make it absolutely clear that we are not going to limit ourselves as to who can be contacted under that particular provision. The minister and I would both agree that we do not want this to happen again. If there is something we can do now to put in place those mechanisms, let us do it straight away as opposed to waiting for the next event to occur. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069152"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member. The advice from my advisers is that it is not just natural persons. I take the member’s point. You advise practitioners, for example, when you are talking about health and other practitioners. I am told that it will encompass organisations. However, I will also look at that in the context of a broader examination of the issue of how we deal with privacy. This relates to children; it does not relate to people more generally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069153"></A>
The member for Burleigh has raised the issue before that when an adult with no children has been in an institution and they are released into the community, there is a need to tell the people who are caring for them, frankly, what their condition is, how they might identify them and those sorts of issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069178"></A>
There is a question about whether privacy obligations would have been a problem there in any case. I know that as we get more and more issues about protecting privacy people then tend to throw the baby out with the bathwater. I intend to look at this issue more broadly, not just in relation to children, because we are fundamentally concerned with having patients in an appropriate area, getting appropriate support from people who can give them that support with appropriate knowledge. I am told that it would relate to other persons as is appropriate, but I will look at that again in a more ongoing sense. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think the minister made the comment that he would now look at broadening the whole aspect of the privacy matter to deal with assisting people who have a mental illness. So that may well go further into looking at privacy issues in the adult area as well. I think that would be an excellent idea. There are so many people in our society who are in need of that help and assistance. Whatever we can do to facilitate their moving back into mainstream society would be of enormous benefit to them and to us and also to the health dollar. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069183"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes. The point being that the member might have a cousin who is an adult who is released from a secure facility and they will say, ‘Mr McArdle, this is the health condition that your cousin has. You have to make sure that he takes three pills a day. If he manifests this behaviour, please ring us straightaway.’ I think we should address those issues. I am not raising this because the member has raised it with me in this bill. I have indicated for some time now that I want to deal with this issue. I have said it in a number of public places. I want to do it not because this is in the bill but because I am concerned that we adequately support people in the community. That then means in certain circumstances making sure that their family and other people who might be supporting them are adequately advised of their mental condition so that they can support them and know what is going wrong. </Hansard-Body>

Amendment 3 formally recognises a registration arrangement that the Medical Board of Queensland has in place for retired doctors. The amendment inserts a new section 150AD in the Medical Practitioners Registration Act which serves two purposes. Firstly, the provision provides protection for patients and the public by providing clear guidance on what retired doctors may and may not do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069193"></A>
Under the Medical Practitioners (Registration) Regulation, the Medical Board may waive the fee for a retired doctor to register either as a general or specialist registrant on the condition the doctor does not draw any income from practising the profession. Retired doctors traditionally only provide repeat prescriptions and referrals and may occasionally volunteer to assist in basic procedures during times of stress in the health system--such times may include during a pandemic or natural disaster or in remote areas during absences of the local medical practitioner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069194"></A>
It is necessary for protecting patients to restrict the practices which retired doctors may engage in. Retired doctors who are not providing regular health services and who are not engaging in ongoing professional development are at risk of losing competency and having outdated knowledge which may place patients at risk. Formally limiting the scope of practice that a retired doctor may engage in ensures that any risk from the potential loss of skill and knowledge will be minimal. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069195"></A>
The second purpose of this provision--and this is important--is to provide formal recognition of this arrangement to ensure that retired doctors in Queensland appropriately transition to the national scheme. If we did not do this, the national scheme would not allow retired doctors in Queensland because there is not a statutory basis for them. In my discussions with the AMA, they indicated that this was an issue that they had some concern with for doctors. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069196"></A>
I am very sympathetic to the role of retired doctors. I think they do wonderful things in our community and to give them a pat on the back and to say thank you and acknowledge that is not an inappropriate thing to do. There will be a grandfathering clause to permit any retired registrant with a specified limited scope of practice to transition to the national scheme, but there will be no new admittees. I would have preferred to have it a bit broader but that is what we were able to deal with at a national level. My department consulted with the AMA in relation to this. This is seeking to make sure that when we go to the national scheme retired doctors who are currently allowed to practice as retired doctors are continued to be recognised. </Hansard-Body>

Tabled paper:</Hansard-Italic>
 Explanatory notes to amendments to be moved to the Health and Other Legislation Amendment Bill by the member for Caloundra.</Hansard-Paper-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069203"></A>
This amendment deals with the reportable conduct provision. The history in this state, and undoubtedly elsewhere across the nation, shows that this sort of legislation had to occur. The bill before the House provides for the misconduct to have occurred under three or four different sets of circumstances and also requires that if the first registrant becomes aware that the second registrant has engaged in reportable misconduct that person must then be reported to the relevant authority. The bill is very black and white. The amendment that we are moving here this afternoon provides some exceptions. I am acutely aware of the minister’s amendment that he will move subsequent to this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1069204"></A>
The opposition has proposed in the amendment that we exclude three sets of circumstances. The first is where a spouse is the first registrant operating in a clinical arena with the second registrant. The second is where there is a medical practitioner seeking the assistance of a medical practitioner to overcome problems. The third set of circumstances is in relation to the insurance industry, which both the opposition and the government agree on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073506"></A>
In relation to the scenario of the spouse, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate it certainly has not been easy to come to the determination that a spouse should not be required to lodge a misconduct complaint with the board. However, I believe the marital relationship is a cornerstone of our society. It is one of the most important fabrics that dictates who we are and what we are. The spousal relationship is defined within the terms of the bill to include heterosexual, homosexual and other relationships as well, so it covers myriad scenarios. The importance of the spousal relationship in my opinion cannot be underestimated, and we believe it is important to protect that relationship. In relation to sexual misconduct, that relationship would not in my opinion sustain such an allegation, but under the set of circumstances we believe that the exemption should apply to protect that relationship. </Hansard-Body>
<DIV>

</DIV>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073508"></A>
The other point where the government and the opposition differ is in relation to a doctor treating a practitioner for a medical condition or impairment of some sort. It has been the practice for a long time for medical practitioners to seek assistance when they face difficulties that could impact upon their capacity to deliver a safe and efficient service to their clients. The concern is that, if we impose upon another practitioner the obligation to report a reportable misconduct, we risk practitioners not seeking the assistance they normally would have sought--thus driving them underground.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073509"></A>
What we do not want is a scenario where practitioners do not seek help because they are concerned they will be reported to the relevant board. What we do want is practitioners who are able to seek assistance knowing that they will receive the treatment and the guidance they need to return to the medical practice and continue on with their good work. There is an obligation on practitioners to provide a safe and harm-free service to their clients, and I believe there is a very strong ethical and moral obligation on medical practitioners to ensure that other doctors in fact do the same. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073510"></A>
At the end of the day, we are saying that reporting as a concept is fine. It may have solved many problems in this state and elsewhere if it had been in place some time ago. We are concerned about the issue of spouses being required to make a report on their spouse, and we are concerned that doctors may fail to seek treatment from another doctor. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073511"></A>
The issue of the insurance industry is self-explanatory. When we discuss that particular portion of the government’s amendment, there is one point I will raise in relation to terminology.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073512"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The government will be opposing the amendment moved by the member for Caloundra. I am not going to go into the reason why we should have mandatory reporting. The member accepts that we should have a mandatory reporting scheme. It is merely about the extent to which it applies.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073513"></A>
I will make a couple of observations. First of all, this bill that we are debating at the moment is the state bill, which is the law in relation to Queensland up until the time that the national law is adopted from next year. If we did nothing or if we do something that is inconsistent with the national regime--whilst we can do that because we are the master of our own destiny in this parliament here--it would be a bit peculiar. So the amendments I foreshadow I will move will make sure that the Queensland provisions are identical to the provisions in the national scheme. It is really quite silly to do anything other than that, although I do acknowledge the sovereign right of the parliament to do that. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073514"></A>
I have to take issue with the opposition in relation to spouse reporting. The honourable member referred to the past protections in the Criminal Code. They are about compellability; they are not about the same thing as spouse reporting. I do not want people to think that I do not understand the difference between whether someone is a compellable witness or someone has an obligation to report. Having said that, we have taken a view that those issues are anachronistic, bearing in mind the modern circumstances.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073515"></A>
Whilst the family unit is very important--and the honourable member acknowledged that--I frankly do not think in relation to the professional obligations of a practitioner that it overrides the importance of their duty to report someone. This will only apply to spouses if, for example, they are in practice together--not if a spouse is not in a medical practice position or a professional practice position vis-a-vis their partner. But if you are a GP and you referred someone to a specialist who happens to be your spouse or you are in partnership with a specialist who happens to be your spouse, then you have misconducted yourself and I think that absolutely needs to be reported. At that point, the member for Caloundra and I part company on the issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073516"></A>
The other issue that the member for Caloundra identified is the issue of doctors seeking treatment from other doctors. Whilst I acknowledge that is a far stronger point than the point in relation to spouses, it still is a matter of balancing what is the most important protection. Is the most important protection the important issue of someone getting appropriate support and advice, or is the most important protection protecting the patient, because ultimately it is the patient who will get injured? Everyone can make their arguments about driving things underground all the time, but ultimately that is always the argument when you have mandatory reporting regimes. That is always the argument when you make people report things like that--that you will do it underground. It is a hoary old argument and it is one that deserves to be rejected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073517"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have a couple of points. The minister commented about this particular law only being in place until 1 July 2010. Of course that may not happen. We do not know what is going to happen in the other jurisdictions at this time. Therefore, we have to work on the basis that this legislation will be the law in Queensland until such time. We have to accept that as a fait accompli.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073518"></A>
The other point is, if you run the argument that the overwhelming protection lies with the patient, why exempt the insurance industry? Why say that the spouse must report and the doctor must report but the insurance industry is not required to report? Why does the government say that the spouse and the doctor have a higher threshold of obligation than the insurance industry, which receives exactly the same information, details and evidence as the doctor or the spouse? It is inconsistent to say two are not exempt but one is exempt if the overriding principle is that the health of the patient is paramount. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073519"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I do not think the AMA would like it if the member advocated that we remove the exemption from the insurance industry. The simple point is this: the insurance industry is a voluntary, private industry that can elect to insure or not insure people depending upon how they perceive the nature of the risk. We cannot make them insure people. I suppose there could be a compulsory third party sort of scheme, but I have never heard of that applying to this. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073520"></A>
Frankly, if they do not ultimately support the scheme, they will not insure people, and how will that affect the patients? It will mean that any patient who sees a doctor will not have the benefit of them having a professional negligence scheme, and that is not a very good idea.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073521"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Minister, what you are doing though is putting in place a position at the end by saying that you need to insure the doctor after the injury has occurred. Again, it is inconsistent to say that two of the three should not be exempt but the third one should be. It just does not follow on a logical sequence if you say that the patient’s health is paramount. If the patient’s health is paramount, it should be paramount in all sets of circumstances. If you are going to make an exception or an exemption for one--</Hansard-Body>

 I thought you were going to cave in. I thought you were going to give me an exemption. The position is this: two situations do not warrant the exemption; the third one does.

Clause 61 of the bill amends the Medical Practitioners Registration Act 2001 to require doctors to notify the Medical Board if they become aware or reasonably suspect that another doctor has engaged in a reportable misconduct. The provisions in this clause were drafted as far as possible to be consistent with the national approach to mandatory reporting for health professionals endorsed by the Australian health ministers on 5 March 2009 as part of the implementation of the national scheme. The national scheme is to be fully implemented by 1 July 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073568"></A>
On 6 October 2009 I introduced the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill 2009--the second stage. The national law bill includes mandatory reporting provisions for health professionals. It provides certain exemptions from the reporting obligation. It only requires reporting of serious misconduct that involves a significant departure from accepted professional standards. It is important that the reporting obligation for Queensland doctors that will be introduced in the bill is as far as possible consistent with the reporting obligations for health professionals in the national law bill. This will assist with the transition to the national scheme.  </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073569"></A>
Amendment No. 4 exempts doctors from the reporting obligations where they know or reasonably believe that the reportable misconduct has already been reported to the Medical Board. This will avoid multiple reporting of the same matter. The proposed amendment also specifies the circumstances in which a doctor is not taken to have become aware or reasonably suspect that a fellow doctor has engaged in reportable misconduct and therefore has no reporting obligation arising from these circumstances. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073571"></A>
The circumstances set out in the amendment are as follows: if the doctor is employed or otherwise engaged by a professional indemnity insurer and suspects or becomes aware of the other doctor’s misconduct as a result of a disclosure made during legal proceedings, or in the provision of legal advice arising from the insurance policy, or where the doctor suspects or becomes aware of the other doctor’s misconduct when providing advice about the misconduct for the purposes of legal proceedings or the preparation of legal advice, or where the doctor is also a lawyer and suspects or becomes aware of the other doctor’s misconduct when providing legal services to the other doctor in relation to legal proceedings or the preparation of legal advice in which the reportable conduct was an issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1073572"></A>
The exemptions ensure that the reporting obligation does not apply where doctors come into possession of information about reportable misconduct pursuant to legal proceedings or the provision of legal advice including the information that may be subject to legal professional privilege. The proposed amendment also inserts a replacement definition of the term ‘harm’ which is used in the definition of ‘reportable misconduct’. The new definition varies from the definition in this bill to the extent that a detrimental effect on a person’s physical or psychological wellbeing does not need to be of a significant nature to constitute harm. I ask the House to support the amendment.</Hansard-Body>

Just to make it clear, this actually goes closer to what the AMA wants than what was in the original bill. The original bill was the Queensland legislation. We have indicated that we want to make it consistent with the national law that will start from 1 July next year. So that is an appropriate way to proceed. </Hansard-Body>

 </Hansard-Bold>
(5.13 pm): This particular clause relates to what is termed a ‘smoking related product’ and leaves to a regulation what is to be defined under that terminology. The explanatory notes state in essence that it is expected that certain things will be and it is expected that certain things will not be. We know that there are many people in this state who derive part of their income from selling what may well become a smoking related product. What I am concerned about is that when we put into legislation what will be a prescriptive provision--that is, it will have a criminal sanction or quasi-criminal sanction by way of failing to comply with the terms of the bill and it will also have a form of negative commercial or economic impact upon a person who now sells those items legally--we should include the detail in the bill. The <Hansard-Italic>
Legislation Alert </Hansard-Italic>
has made it quite clear on many occasions that when we put in place prescriptive provisions they should definitely be contained in the bill. It raises the question whether a regulation is the appropriate method of putting those through the parliament when the potential for debate, and in-depth debate, is exceptionally limited. I ask the Deputy Premier this: what are the circumstances that warrant, in this case, a regulation which may come at some time in the future putting in place a regime that is prescriptive? Why could it not be put into a bill now so that people know from day one exactly what is going to occur and also give the parliament fuller and, in my opinion, franker capacity to deal with the issues as opposed to waiting for them to come through by way of regulation?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077573"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 This provision is not intended to penalise retailers. It is because there are some smoking related products that potentially are inadvertently prohibited from sale because they have the same brand name as the smoking product--for example, a Zig-Zag cigarette roller. When it is a smoking related product one can sell it as a smoking related product. If it is not a smoking related product but it is seen to have things about smoking on it, one cannot sell it. In terms of actually wanting to clarify things, the opposite is the case in terms of what the member is concerned about.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077575"></A>
I do not accept that it is not inappropriate to have it dealt with by regulation so we can quickly respond to those issues to stop problems arising for retailers and others so they can have certainty. I do not think a class of smoking related product is a really big class when it comes to how this act applies to it and in terms of giving people certainty. I think it is very simple to debate in a disallowance motion whether it is or it is not.</Hansard-Body>

This is the lengthy clause that deals with smoking in motor vehicles. The terms of the bill actually provide two offences--one in relation to a business vehicle and one in relation to what may well be termed a private vehicle. In terms of a business vehicle, the bill does not permit smoking if there is any person in the vehicle. In terms of a private vehicle, the bill does not permit smoking if there is person under the age of 16 years in the vehicle.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077636"></A>
And he goes on. As I said, this bill provides two different offences. There may well be circumstances that the minister will outline to me as to why the government wants to take this line. My argument is that if smoking is a killer then it is a killer whether it is in a business vehicle or in a private vehicle. If we want to deter people from smoking and if we want to assist in ensuring that people live longer and healthier lives and at the same time save significant costs to the Health budget in relation to chronic disease, we should put in place uniformity in relation to those matters that we feel should be dealt with to save those dollars. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077637"></A>
If it is safe and if it is advisable to ensure that the business vehicle is smoke free--and there may well be other reasons as to why that should occur--then, in my opinion, for those health reasons we should also apply this law to a private vehicle. Why can I not smoke if my 17-year-old son is my passenger in a business vehicle yet I can smoke if that same son is sitting next to me in my private vehicle? If we are trying to send a message not only through this bill but also in relation to the issue of chronic disease prevention and treatment, it should be consistent. At the end of the day, if we save one person from the agonising death of cancer via direct or passive smoking then that is one person to whom we have given an exceptionally long life, to whom we have given fulfilment in relation to having a family--a future they may not have had. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member. The opposition’s amendment is about as silly as you can get. Not smoking in work cars is already the law in Queensland. So we are not seeking to ban smoking in work cars. The reason it is mentioned in the legislation is that we are moving it from one part of the legislation to another. I just want to make it clear that that was put into law a little while ago.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077639"></A>
 There is a world of difference when it comes to smoking in cars as opposed to smoking in public vehicles that are used for work purposes. There are certain obligations under occupational health and safety laws that apply in relation to work cars. It is quite a different issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077640"></A>
In relation to children, we agree that there should not be smoking, because they are not of the appropriate age when they can make a decision. If they are in the car with their parents, they cannot ask to get out. We need to protect them. Also, of course, in many instances children have not yet made the decision to smoke or not to smoke. What the member is doing is not only exposing them to passive smoking but also increasing their exposure to the likelihood of wanting to smoke in the first place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077641"></A>
To then take it to the nth degree by saying, ‘We are going to ban smoking in cars when adults are there,’ is like saying, ‘If you are a husband and wife and one of you smokes at home but you do not mind when the other one smokes at home, you cannot hop in the car together while one of you smokes.’ But worse still--and more ludicrous--this amendment will mean that if you have a husband and wife who both smoke and who both smoke together at home, they cannot smoke together in their car unless they pull into the garage at home or they cannot smoke in the car unless they pull up by the side of the road and one of them hops out and goes down the road and has a ciggie while the other one stays in the car and then that one hops out and goes down the road and has a cigarette. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077642"></A>
That is ridiculous. If the member wants to have consistency then he should be seeking to amend the law to ban smoking altogether, including in homes. That means prohibition and then we will have organised crime move in. We know about total prohibition. This amendment strikes a sensible balance. For the opposition to suggest--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1077645"></A>
 It is ludicrous to suggest that two adults, both of whom smoke, cannot smoke together in a car. It is politically correct, ridiculous nonsense.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077651"></A>
 Smoking is a killer. The minister knows it and I know it. If the minister wants to stop people from smoking, we are going to have to make the hard yards because, unfortunately, that is the way our society is. If the minister does not like the idea, he should resign from the portfolio and give it to someone else who is prepared to do it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077652"></A>
Cancer is derived from cigarette smoke. That is an undeniable fact. The minister and I both know that. If it is fine to ban smoking in work vehicles because of workplace health and safety or occupational issues because of the dangers involved, the same must apply in relation to people in private vehicles. There is no difference. Cigarette smoke does not differentiate between a business vehicle and a private vehicle. It does not do that. </Hansard-Body>

Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 With all due respect, if the minister wants to make a comment, could he please do so after I finish? Smoke does not differentiate between whether it is a public or a private vehicle. It will kill you just as quickly in either vehicle. It will cause the cancer, it will cause the suffering, just as quickly. If we are serious about tackling chronic disease and if we are serious about battling the impacts of chronic disease then we should get serious. We stand here today in the House deciding that we are going to make some tough decisions. Let us make some tough decisions. The minister should not vacillate between what he thinks is tough and what he thinks is too easy. The minister should make the hard choices. If he wants to save lives, if he wants to save the Health budget, he should approve the amendment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077655"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to oppose the amendment for this reason. In my contribution to the second reading debate I talked about the fact that smokers feel very put upon. I agree with the opposition member: smoking does kill. We have all acknowledged that. But banning smoking in work vehicles is different from banning smoking in private vehicles. Banning smoking in private vehicles where there are minors is different from banning smoking en masse. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077656"></A>
Many adults smoke. It is an addiction. We have to acknowledge that. We are asking adults to be responsible. We are asking adults to accept that, after this bill passes, it is going to be an offence to smoke with a child in the car. I do not have any problem supporting that, because children do not have a great deal of power to ask their parents to stop smoking while they are in the car. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077657"></A>
However, if the opposition’s amendment passes, you would potentially have an adult on their own in a vehicle travelling from their home to town to shop who would not be able to light up a cigarette. These people have an addiction. These people see smoking as an acceptable pastime. On that basis, I would find it very difficult to support the reduction of that civil liberty of people to be able to smoke on their own in a vehicle. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077691"></A>
I acknowledge that smoking kills. I lost my dad to cigarette smoke. He began smoking because the Army gave him cigarettes to cope with World War II. He died directly as a result of cigarette smoking. Mum and I are the only two people in our family who do not smoke. The others all light up like three-funnel steamers. I know that banning smoking in their vehicles when they are on their own will be counterproductive. They will have three cigarettes before they leave home, they will jump in the car and run into town in 10 minutes and have a couple more when they jump out. It will not help them with their addiction. It will probably exacerbate it. </Hansard-Body>

I agree with the preclusion of smoking with minors in the vehicle. As an asthmatic I do not enjoy getting into a vehicle where there has been smokers and the odour is still in there. It is very upsetting. But I cannot support legislation that precludes an adult who is a smoker driving in a vehicle that they own having a smoke; not because smoking does not kill, because it does, but because somewhere we have to draw a line in the sand and say that people have to be responsible for their own actions. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to support the shadow minister. I urge all members to vote for this amendment. While listening to the debate here today a couple of other reasons have crossed my mind as to why this amendment should be supported. First of all, the minister is not acknowledging the fact that there are accidents that have been caused by people smoking cigarettes whilst driving. It is a bit like driving along talking on a mobile phone. There must be plenty of accidents that have been caused by the act of physically smoking a cigarette. It is not too long a bow to draw. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077694"></A>
The minister tries to use the comparison of consenting adults smoking in a car and smoking at home. There is a large difference between smoking in a car and smoking at home. If two adults are in a house and one is smoking, the other adult can leave the room. A person cannot exactly leave a car. The other thing I would like the House and the minister to consider was brought up by the member for Coomera and that is the issue of fire. If all smoking in cars was banned then there would be less chance of bushfires. </Hansard-Body>

 I cannot believe that the minister actually laughed then. Does he not think that bushfires are created by people driving along in cars and throwing cigarette butts out the window? Obviously his reaction means that he does not believe that bushfires are created by smokers who throw cigarette butts out of the car. Let us get real. </Hansard-Body>

Mr MESSENGER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the member for Clayfield that maybe he should speak to the emergency services minister and the people who have been fighting bushfires in the northern part of our state around North Burnett and Rockhampton. They could tell the minister just how many fires have been created by people who have been smoking in cars. For those reasons I think that our shadow minister should be wholeheartedly congratulated and supported. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Let us deconstruct all of this. First of all, the opposition amendment does not ban smoking in cars full stop. The member for Burnett said we should ban smoking in cars because it causes bushfires. The opposition legislation does not ban smoking in cars; it bans smoking in cars if someone else is present. That is what it bans. I will read the amendment--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077703"></A>
The problem in terms of what the member has just said is that he has contradicted himself with his own legislation. In any case, as it is what does he think is going to happen? The way those opposite have drafted the law if there are two people in the car and one wants to smoke they are going to have to hop out of the car. If a person is smoking in a car and instead of putting it in the ashtray throws the cigarette butt out of the window it can start a fire. But if a person is standing out in the middle of the bush because they have had to get out of the car to smoke, where are they going to put the cigarette butt then unless they take an ashtray with them? How ludicrous can one get. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077704"></A>
I will respond to the member for Caloundra when he said if it is good enough to ban smoking in business cars then it is good enough to ban it in private cars. If it is good enough to ban smoking in businesses it is good enough to ban smoking in houses, but those opposite are not doing that. In terms of the arguments advanced by the member for Burnett, he is not suggesting we ban them in the loungeroom but not the dining room. This is really ridiculous. It shows that those opposite do not understand questions of degree. The member for Gladstone understands it. Most normal people understand it. It is totally ridiculous. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1077705"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 If I could address the comment made by the member for Gladstone, the amendment does not say that if I am alone in the car I cannot smoke. I can smoke in those circumstances. If I have somebody else the car I cannot smoke. </Hansard-Body>

Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The interjection from the man who believes he is running the education department should be considered in the context of it being nonsensical, ludicrous and of no value, as usual. He cannot even interject from his right seat. Let us get down to tin tacks here. If it is right to ban smoking because of workplace health and safety issues in a work vehicle, why do you do that? You do it because you do not want people consuming cigarette tobacco, I would have thought. Logically, if we are saving a life in that vehicle, we should save a life in a private vehicle as well. One can smoke in the vehicle to their heart’s content if one is on their own. What we are simply saying is a person cannot smoke if there is somebody else in the vehicle with them. It gives uniformity in relation to the law. It does not differentiate between different classes of people or different classes of vehicles.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1077708"></A>
The minister made the point why not just ban smoking altogether. We know that the Cancer Council would love to have that happen. We know that at some point in time, by the gradual degree of increasing taxes and putting prohibitions in place, there will come a time when it will drop down to about 7 or 8 per cent. We accept that that is about the lowest we are going to get without taking a definitive step to ban smoking entirely. But everything that we do to try to eliminate the risk of someone dying from lung cancer and chronic disease has to be a positive step and for the betterment of everybody in our society. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1077709"></A>
Banning smoking will not happen in my lifetime, nor anybody else’s in this chamber, but if we do not start taking the decisions and putting in place the methods of assisting people to live a healthy lifestyle, we are simply and straightforwardly not up to the game of being a member of parliament.

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (5.47 pm): This is the clause that relates to the nurse practitioner amendment. I am not going to go through a debate about the issue of nurse practitioners. During the second reading debate--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082289"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Interjected>
Mr Lucas</Hansard-Member-Interjected>
 interjected. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082290"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I think the minister and I share a similar point of view there anyway. The nurse practitioners will continue to fulfil, in my opinion, an increasingly important role in the medical profession in Queensland. I know they have been rolled out, if I can use that term, over the past few years in Queensland and there are plans to utilise 30 more over the next two or three years, if I recall the budget correctly. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082291"></A>
There is also the issue of physicians’ assistants, which is on trial here in Queensland. I think there are three now in the state. I am not strictly speaking in terms of the clause, but I am eager to understand how the minister sees that particular position utilised in Queensland and whether you see a greater expansion of their services outside of the ED and into the rural areas as well to assist in relation to medical shortages across Queensland? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082292"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for his question. So you are not talking about physicians’ assistants; you are talking about nurse practitioners? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr McArdle:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 My apologies, yes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082294"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 A lot of nurse practitioners--not all of them--have gone into our emergency departments. The honourable member recognises the role that they are performing there, so I will not go into detail. Clearly we will want to have more of them, particularly helping triage and treating category 4 and 5 patients. The member for Mount Isa spoke about that herself as well. For example, we would see them rolling out more in areas such as acute illnesses like renal issues and those sorts of areas. They are highly qualified people. They have masters degrees as well as their extensive undergraduate and practical experience. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082295"></A>
I should draw to the attention of the honourable member one issue that I have raised with the Commonwealth government to which I think it needs to give more serious thought. It said that it will allow Medicare billing for nurse practitioners in private practice. The problem with that is that if we are talking about that as a solution in remote areas, it is not likely that a nurse practitioner will have a viable private practice in a tiny area, any more than a single doctor would have a viable private practice. Just as the medical superintendent is partially paid by us with a right to private practice, the federal government has to allow Medicare billing for nurse practitioners in remote locations who have dual public sector practice and a right to private practice. It is its decision to do that. I have told the federal government that if it really wants to get serious about rolling out nurse practitioners in remote locations that is what it will need to do. That is one aspect. The other aspect is that with an increase in acute illnesses--renal and those sorts of things--nurse practitioners work in those areas as well. When I was a lawyer--and the member opposite would probably recall this, too--police prosecutors often did not have the same legal training as a solicitor, but they had incredible experience in a very narrow area of the law. So they were pretty good at it. Indeed, they were better than many solicitors would have been because they practised more in that area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1082296"></A>
The honourable member agrees with me on the philosophy of nurse practitioners. I think the ability to extend them further will be an important aspect of assisting us in dealing with patient processing all over Queensland. I am particularly keen to see what we can do to help further roll out services in rural and remote Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (5.52 pm): Clause 7 exempts a number of Queensland statutes from the operation of the bill. In relation to the exemptions, if we look in schedule 1, towards the rear, we find the adoption of Commonwealth legislation where it is appropriate. Can the minister clarify whether the protections that Queenslanders now enjoy under Queensland legislation are replicated under Commonwealth legislation? Is there a distinction, for example, in the FOI legislation and the Right to Information Act between Queensland and the Commonwealth that would adversely impact upon the rights that Queenslanders have now? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086706"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Regrettably, I cannot give the member that undertaking. They have to be subject to some legislation. As far as I am aware, at the present time the Queensland FOI legislation--I am not here to give the House legal advice--is actually broader than the Commonwealth legislation. But they are talking about doing other things. No, I cannot give that undertaking because it has to have some law applying to it. If Commonwealth FOI laws apply to it, they will apply to it in accordance with their terms. That is one of the trade-offs that one has with national legislation. </Hansard-Body>

The police commissioner may give criminal history information ...</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086712"></A>
If we look in schedule 1 we see that the application is made by the relevant board in checking registration et cetera. Just to clarify, the word ‘may’ in normal legal parlance provides a discretion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086713"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Lucas:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 They may not, too. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086715"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 They may not as well. I am concerned that the Police Commissioner will in fact be obligated to provide the information, so should the word be ‘must’? I know the word ‘may’ in certain circumstances can mean ‘must’. But to ensure that there is no argument, should the word ‘may’ be ‘must’ in these circumstances given the thread that runs through the national law? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086716"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. I seek the indulgence of the House to turn to the relevant page in the national law, which is very large. At present in Queensland there is not necessarily mandatory criminal history checking, although many boards do observe it in most, if not all, instances. So this is a significant improvement on that. With government employees, we do that as a matter of course in any case. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086717"></A>
My understanding is that the reason this clause was put in the bill itself--not clause 79 in the national law but the provision in our own law--was merely that the Queensland police wanted further Queensland legislative support for their ability to provide the information. So it was merely a procedural provision, not something that would give them the power to refuse. All police commissioners have a similar discretionary provision. I do not know whether they have a similar provision to that. That is my advice. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1086718"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I understand the minister’s comment that all commissioners have that discretion. I know it is very unlikely that it is going to occur. I understand that very clearly. But if the national law is based in part upon application for registration that a criminal history check is done, it is very important that a criminal history, which not only covers offences but also covers what I term spent offences and also charges, actually be supplied. We do not want a circumstance arising down the track where a commissioner, for whatever reason, hypothetically may determine to not provide the information. Again I accept that that would be most unusual. I am concerned that that discretion continues to exist as opposed to a compulsion, given that it is a national scheme for medical practitioners to provide service to their patients. </Hansard-Body>

Clause 12--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091238"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (5.59 pm): Clause 12 deals with the capacity of the ministerial council to provide directions to the national agency and the national board in relation to the policies to be applied by those entities when exercising their functions under the national law. There has been a concern from day one about the power of the ministerial council. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, the ministerial council is not an elected body in the sense that the practitioners covered by the national bill will dictate who will lead them. It is an organisation that shifts with a change in either the government or the ministers across the states, territories and federally.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091239"></A>
Part 7 to be inserted, however, provides what has been termed a reserve power or a right within the national ministerial council to actually provide policies as to how the board and the agency will operate. The concern is that the ministerial council, by being able to issue these various documents, can actually direct the relevant boards and the relevant agencies. As I understand clause 12 and the national bill itself, these directions are binding upon the relevant board and the relevant agency. Many people have raised the question of whether this is potentially a de facto power stream that the councils can use in relation to how these boards and the agency operate, to the effect that the intergovernmental agreement as it stood in 2008 will in fact continue to enshrine the ultimate power in the ministerial council.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091240"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would have thought as a matter of statutory interpretation that, where there are specific provisions in relation to the law that put some limits on the power of the ministerial council, they will apply to the exclusion of general provisions such as this. With respect, the policy issue is really just amending the existing act to reflect the bill’s provisions, but I am happy to deal with it here anyway. For example, the one that people have raised issues about is the power of the ministerial council to provide reserve power directions when it comes to the workforce and qualifications and the like. There is a specific way in which it must do that and what they must do to do that. The ability to issue a general policy cannot override the specific requirements on them by way of procedure.</Hansard-Body>

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (6.02 pm): This relates to the fact that an entity has to perform its functions in accordance with the objectives and the guiding principles of the national scheme. We know that there are a number of entities here--the ministerial council, up to 14 boards, the agency, the state board or territory board, other panels et cetera--which can be appointed under the terms of this legislation. The bill says that the entity has to perform the function in accordance with the objectives and principles of the legislation. Is there a mechanism in place to ensure that that in fact does occur? That is, who oversees and who supervises the relevant subsections that fall from the ministerial council? Is the ministerial council charged with ensuring that the actions of the agency and the boards are performed in accordance with the functions and objectives of the national law, or is there some external body that takes on the role? For example, the Auditor-General and the Ombudsman in Queensland have certain powers. Who fulfils that role under this hierarchical structure?</Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I do not think it is any different to any other objection principles clause. A direction is for those who administer the relevant provisions of the act to administer them with those in mind, for those who then make judicial interpretations of the act to administer them with those in mind, for those who then audit them--if it is a financial matter, such as the Auditor-General--to check whether people have done them in accordance with those principles. As the honourable member knows, these sorts of provisions in acts--that is, the objects clauses--are standard things. They do assist in interpretation; they do assist with a footprint. In many instances, they are not really of themselves justiciable because they talk about broad principles. You and I might both support a particular principle but think that it means a totally different thing, but we do not head off to court about it. It is more how that might aid a court or others in interpreting how the legislation might be provided. I do not think I can take it any further than that.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (6.06 pm): This is the issue with regard to the council having the capacity to issue policy directions to both the agency and the various boards. Subclause 11(3) indicates that the council can issue those in relation to an administrative process, a procedure or even an accreditation standard. As we know, an accreditation standard, under the terms of the national law, is the methodology and the course that a student must go through to achieve a qualification. The ministerial council is in fact retaining a reserve power, and it has a very wide reserve power because there is no limit to what it can or cannot do. In fact, subclause (3) states that it ‘may relate to’ the points that then follow.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091250"></A>
What is of concern is that the council again still holds a significant power; it still holds enormous sway particularly in relation to the boards because of their authority and their purpose under the act. There is a real concern that, if the ministerial council does not operate in an open and consultative manner, there could be problems down the track. Can the minister confirm that a process that involves the issuing of a policy to either the boards or the agency will entail consultation with the boards, or if not with the boards then with some other organisation qualified to do so? It may well be the advisory council which offers the advice to the council on an ongoing basis.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1091251"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 First of all, the honourable member might be interested to know that the minister in Queensland already has a power in relation to this without the second qualification on it that we are seeking to put into the national law. In fact, what we are doing is actually tightening up the powers that I technically have at the present time. Whilst I acknowledge the medical profession’s concerns about these powers, I actually have them at the moment in terms of our state regulations and I do not have the requirement to consider first ‘the potential impact of the council’s direction on the quality and safety of health care’. We have actually put that in there in response to the committee and the medical colleges. I expect that the ministerial council would very clearly take into account the various views in relation to this.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095683"></A>
One of the problems is this. We have talked about nurse practitioners before. Not all of the health professions have a common view on these things. Some of them have a different view amongst themselves. I have said this to the nursing profession before. Some of them get antsy when the doctors do not want the nurses to have more powers, but the nurses sometimes get antsy when other people want to have more powers. Some of them do not like physician’s assistants. It is important, particularly in a state like Queensland, to make sure that we continue the supply of appropriate practitioners. We have seen in the past the ACCC look at the conduct of some specialist medical colleges which have restricted access to their professions. They are a lot better than that these days. I do not see them doing that particularly. But we do need to have reserve powers in government. As long as you can justify that they are there in very minor and appropriate circumstances, I think the community would expect us to be able to have that power.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095694"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (6.12 pm): I want to combine 19 and 20 together. They really do flow on. They relate to the issue of advice by the advisory council to the ministerial council. In particular, the advisory council gives advice to the council which is considered by the council. The council is then required to publish the advice, unless the advisory council says, for various reasons, that part or all of the advice should not be published. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095695"></A>
In relation to advice, as you and I know, when we get advice from council, council sets out all the facts, all the considerations and then gives what is called an opinion at the end. The education minister would know that as well. Is the publication just the end or is it the whole document that is published? That is, is it the consideration by the advisory council and potentially facts, or is it just the gist of a document that is the advice itself? Because there could well be factors that others may take issue with. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095696"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Are you asking whether it can be published, for example, in part, or if there were certain parts of it that--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095697"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No, what I am saying is that the publication occurs either for the full advice, or if the advisory council says that part or all of the advice should not be published then the council can determine not to publish all or part of the advice. What I am saying is, if the advice is published and there is no requirement that consideration be given to limiting what is published, if you look at an opinion from a barrister you get the facts, you get the law and then you get the opinion. Is it the whole document that is published from the advisory council, because it would relate back to the council the facts and the consideration and then it would come to the conclusion. Is it just the conclusion that is published or the whole document? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095698"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Yes. The advice must be published, which means in total, unless the advisory council recommends that it not be published at all or only in part. If it is to be published in total, there appears to be no discretion in the council to make a determination whether it will or will not publish the document; it must do so. What I am simply asking is: is it the whole document that is published or just, as you and I would understand, the base opinion at the end which you and I would refer to as the advice?</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095705"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (6.16 pm): Clause 26 refers to health profession agreements, which is a function of the national agency. Later on in the bill it deals with three things--the fact of collecting the fees, the fact of payment of the fees and then the investment of moneys through the national agency. In relation to the fees for each of the boards, they all go into the agency. It appears that the agency develops, in consultation with the boards, a budget and allocates them money. If I have 2,000 members who are doctors and 1,000 members who are chiropractors, do all the fees from the doctors go back to the doctors board, or is there a pro rata adjustment? Or is it just an equal distribution of the moneys that go to the relevant boards? As of today the AMAQ would keep all its fees. Is that how it is going to work under this scenario, or does the agency have some overriding jurisdiction? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095706"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My understanding, with the exception of a situation in New South Wales for doctors that we will not bother going into here, is that they are meant to be self-contained organisations. There is not supposed to be a cross-subsidy from one profession to the other. Having said that, the agency also provides services to particular boards, and I would expect that those services would be charged for by the agency or budgeted for--for want of a better word--in accordance with the demands of the agency of that particular board depending upon its size, the nature of investigations and those sorts of things. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095708"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The national agency also has the capacity to invest funds in what they call Australian currency. That appears later in the bill, but I think it is relevant now to deal with it here. It would imply that the agency will retain at least a portion of all fees collected to provide a budget and funding to the relevant boards. There will also be a capacity for the national agency to invest funds in Australian currency, as it appears later--</Hansard-Body>

(6.20 pm): This refers to the state and territory boards that can be appointed by the national board. I note at (3) that the members of the relevant state or territory boards are in fact appointed by the state minister. Why would the national board that has a representative in each of the states--although of course only the one body--not have the right to appoint the state or territory boards as opposed to a relevant minister? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095742"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I have to say that I was a bit more relaxed about having the national board appoint state board people than some of my ministerial colleagues were. To be honest, I appoint the state boards now. Frankly, if state ministers go off appointing state boards however they like, the national board will say that we are not going to have state boards. It is not my power to decide whether or not we have a state board; it is their power. I do think it is important that there is a bit of state input there because sometimes our Commonwealth and interstate colleagues--those south of border--tend to think that all brilliance stops at the Tweed River or indeed all brilliance stops north of Noosa. I happen to disagree with both. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095746"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (6.22 pm): Clause 88 refers to when the national board asks an education provider for details of those students who have registered in a relevant course and the provider fails to provide that. We know that once the national board, in normal circumstances, receives that information they then contact the student and have that student complete a form and provide certain details. In circumstances where the education provider does not provide that detail, is there a mechanism whereby the national board has some recourse to those students? It is very difficult. Is there any impact upon the student down the track if their details have not been given to the education provider? It is very important that as students go through the relevant training, clinical placements et cetera the national board has the right, as is enshrined in the law, to look at suspension, reporting et cetera. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095747"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I should say that student registration at this level is new to Queensland. We do not have it. New South Wales might do it for medical students. South Australia does it more broadly. It will be a new thing. I think it is totally appropriate because in, say, law students do not have any physical contact with clients until they have attained their degree. That is not the case in the health profession. They perform hands-on roles along the way. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095748"></A>
I would expect that universities would comply with these requirements. I would not expect that students would be penalised as a result of a provider failing to comply with this. I am more than happy to take up that issue--we have another bill to come--in terms of the further drafting in circumstances where universities do not comply. Having said that, universities are substantially dependent upon governments for funding. Whilst it is not an offence for them to not supply this information, I think the money supply would dry up pretty quickly and they might come to the party when it came to a whole lot of students getting very antsy about them not supplying the list. </Hansard-Body>

 (6.25 pm): This relates to employers being required to make a notification in certain circumstances. The member for Moggill raised the issue in his second reading contribution yesterday that when we have a very large corporation that employs a multitude of medical practitioners who is it that will be liable if the report is not made? Will it be the CEO or the board of directors? That can create certain difficulties. I think it is a very valid point raised by the member. I would ask the minister to clarify that. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1095753"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. The honourable member for Moggill yesterday raised the issue of the fact that, in general practice in particular, there are a lot of people who are actually employed by corporate structures. It certainly is the case far more extensively than I thought before I was health minister. This provision relates to employers. My view of the liability provisions would be that they fall back through the general corporate law liability provisions on general officers. But again, I am happy to take that up in the context of our further discussions at a national level. I would have thought it would be the general requirement when duties are placed on companies in that regard. </Hansard-Body>

(6.28 pm): Clause 163 involves the appointment of investigators. The clause does not deal with the procedures that have to be gone through to appoint the investigators. It does not deal with criminal checks and background knowledge. They are appointed, I assume, to a particular board. We would want them having some sort of knowledge, even though it may only be peripheral. What will the procedure be to appoint investigators, these very important people in relation to investigations? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1095758"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I would merely expect that they will make sure they appoint suitable people. I do not think we need to prescribe every particular aspect of these things. What we normally say is that they should be people who are suitably experienced. We do not say that they will have 3.4 years of this, that or the other thing. One of the things about investigators is that they might be totally different for the different complaints that might arise, whether it is a financial thing or a physical thing. It is really something that one would expect to undertake in accordance with usual standards of employment and probity checks. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Callide--LNP) (7.30 pm): The South-East Queensland (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) and Natural Resources Provisions Bill before the House has had a couple of names during its passage to reach this point. I express the hope that the government has given more thought to the bill than was indicated by the somewhat unusual way in which it will change its title.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100671"></A>
The bill seeks to put in place the last piece of the SEQ water reform process. The SEQ water process had its genesis in the water crisis that gripped South-East Queensland during 2005-06. It was a water crisis that was the result of 10 years of inaction by Labor governments. It was a water crisis that can be traced back directly to the decision not to build the Wolffdene Dam by the Goss government when it came to power. It is interesting to look at the people who were central to that--what has turned out to be--disastrous decision. Not only was Wayne Goss directly involved; at the time one of his chief advisers by the name of Kevin Rudd was also very much involved in that decision. It is a decision that already has cost South-East Queensland dearly. As we will see in the information that we will look at tonight in the consideration of this bill, that decision will cost South-East Queenslanders dearly for many, many years to come.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100673"></A>
That decision is a good example of what happens when governments make decisions based on political, short-term fixes rather than on factual information. That decision is a good example of what happens when governments govern using spin and media headlines rather than responsible administration. When the Labor government of Wayne Goss decided not to build the Wolffdene Dam, it put in place the foundations of a water crisis that rocked South-East Queensland for a number of years. During that water crisis, the then Beattie government set up an organisation called the Water Commission. The Water Commission had a very chequered history, to say the least. But in May 2007 the Water Commission delivered its final report which outlined the government’s plan for the reform of the water business in South-East Queensland. That plan involved the separation of the different components of the industry. That plan involved the formation of bulk supply authorities, a bulk transport authority and a Water Grid Manager. The proposal was also for a distribution entity and three retail entities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100675"></A>
At the time there was an enormous amount of debate about the unsuitability of the model, especially with regard to the distribution entity and the retail entities and how the councils, which had traditionally managed the water business for so many years, could get value for money for the assets that they had built up on behalf of their ratepayers over those years. The legislation that we have in the House tonight puts in place a somewhat different model from that last stage of the water reform process. The bulk supply entities have been established, the bulk transport entities have been established and the Water Grid Manager is in place. This legislation that we are debating tonight puts in place the last stage. It is different from the model that was put forward by the Water Commission in 2007--and so it should be. Tonight the opposition supports that difference. We support that difference because it is a different model that has been developed by the councils involved in South-East Queensland. It is not a perfect model by any means--it is not something that the councillors involved are totally happy with--but it is certainly a better model than the one that the government adopted from the Water Commission report in 2007.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100676"></A>
The legislation puts in place three combined distribution retail entities that will own the water and sewage distribution infrastructure and sell water and sewage disposal services to customers. The distribution infrastructure includes the reticulation, the pipes, the reservoirs, the pumps and all non-bulk transport assets and the sewage treatment plants. The entities will own that vast suite of assets that has been built up by the councils over a long period. They will sell and deliver water to the customers. They will collect sewage and deliver it to the treatment plants and they will treat and dispose of the sewage and purchase treated water from the Water Grid Manager. These entities will be established by 1 July 2010 and the three entities will cover three separate council groups. The first one will cover the Brisbane, Scenic Rim, Ipswich, Somerset and Lockyer Valley local government areas. The second one will cover the Gold Coast, Logan and Redlands council areas. The third one will cover the Sunshine Coast and Moreton Bay areas. They will be the retail entities that will retail water to retail customers, so they will be the ones that will be in most direct contact with the customers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100677"></A>
I think it needs to be recognised at the very beginning that the enormous increases in the price of water that the people of South-East Queensland are facing in the years directly ahead of us will not be the responsibility of those retail entities. The big danger that I see for those retail entities, and for the councils that own them, is that they will get the blame. They will be left with the responsibility for the increases in the price of water that South-East Queenslanders are facing as an inevitable consequence of the government’s mismanagement of the water business. As I indicated, that mismanagement began with the refusal of the Goss government to construct the Wolffdene Dam. But that mismanagement has continued and the increases in the cost of water have been made worse by the government’s response to the water crisis. The government built the infamous water grid. I say the ‘infamous’ water grid because, while as a political concept it served the purpose of the Premier and the government of the day, as an engineering reality it has left South-East Queensland with a high-production cost water system and an incredibly high transport cost.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1100678"></A>
It is simply grossly inefficient to desalinate water at the southern end of the Gold Coast and pump it back to Brisbane. Pumping water is an expensive business at the best of times. Pumping desalinated water, the most expensive form of water, over those sorts of distances to try to solve the immediate problem in Brisbane is always going to result in high costs for that water. The government was left with no choice. Because of the time frames in which it had to operate, it simply had to find a political solution to a problem that was of its own making.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105430"></A>
I do not believe that the retail entities that are being formed tonight will not have a very strong pricing power. They will be forced to buy their bulk water from the entities that have already been set up as part of the SEQ water reform. If one looks at the price paths anticipated by the Queensland Water Commission, and made very public on the Queensland Water Commission’s website, it is obvious that the water consumers in South-East Queensland will be slugged with massive water price increases in the years ahead, just as they have been slugged with massive electricity price increases for primarily the same reason--that is, the government’s mismanagement of the system. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1105431"></A>
Every time there is a rise in electricity prices the government tries to sheet the responsibility for those price rises home to somebody else. I have no doubt that responsibility for the water prices that are now built into the system because of the government’s mismanagement, failure to plan and knee-jerk reaction will be sheeted home to some other entity. They are and they will be the responsibility of the Beattie Labor government and the Bligh Labor government. They are the ones who will be responsible. They are the ones who put South-East Queensland into the water crisis and then sought to solve that crisis by the sort of panicked response that we saw in the construction of the desalination plant, the western corridor pipeline and the waste water plants.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105432"></A>
Members who were in this House will remember that at the height of the water crisis we dealt with an emergency water regulation that required those entities to report on a monthly basis to the parliament. Those reports are still being made by those entities. They do not get the public attention they deserve. The report that relates to the Western Corridor Recycled Water Project is particularly instructive. It shows that the government has so far spent $2,493 million on the desalination plants at Gibson Island and Luggage Point, plus the western corridor pipeline. It is almost $2.5 billion. It is an incredible amount of money. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105433"></A>
The report also requires them to report their outcomes. One of the outcomes that the government has achieved from that $2,493 million was reported in August 2009 as 17.26 megalitres of water per day being supplied to Swanbank. It also includes 24 megalitres a day being supplied to Tarong. Tarong can get its water from Boondooma Dam. Boondooma Dam supplies Tarong so it does not need to take the water. It only takes the water because it has to. It is forced by ministerial intervention to take the water. Even if we are generous and include the water that Tarong takes, it is something like 40 megalitres of water per day at a capital cost, not counting the operational costs, of $2.5 billion. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105434"></A>
This is a financial legacy that will cripple the water users of South-East Queensland for generations to come, because that $2.5 billion worth of capital has to be repaid. As the government is finding out, when those sorts of sums of money are borrowed they have to be repaid. Not only do they have to be repaid, but interest has to be paid on them. The operational costs of this infrastructure have to be repaid. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105435"></A>
It did not have to be that way. We raised in this House over a period of time the absurd practices that were part of the panicked response when the government built that water grid. I remember raising in here the concept of ‘do it and charge’, as the contractors used to call it. ‘Do it and charge’; tender by invoice. That just meant that the contractor did the job and put in his invoice. That was the tender. It did not matter how much it cost. It was just ‘do it and charge the government’. We ended up with a $2.5 billion white elephant that is now a financial millstone around the necks of water consumers in South-East Queensland, and so it will be for generations to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105436"></A>
I believe that the legislation that we consider tonight will allow the government to distance itself from that financial millstone that it has placed around the necks of South-East Queensland water consumers. The impact of that financial millstone will be reflected in the price that the retail authorities will have to charge the householders and the industrial users in South-East Queensland. The Water Commission’s website has a table, which I will table in the House tonight for the benefit of members, that sets out an expected price path for bulk water prices from 2008-09 through to 2017-18. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105438"></A>
Any projections that far ahead have to be conservative at best. Given this government’s ability to project its financial situation, any projections out to 2017-18 would have to be grossly conservative. Let us look at the projections for the next couple of years. In 2007-08 the bulk water price in Brisbane was $628 a megalitre. In 2008-09 it was $902 a megalitre--a 30 per cent increase. When we go to 2009-10 it is $1,162 a megalitre--another 30 per cent increase. In 2010-11 it is $1,409 a megalitre--a 25 per cent increase following the previous two 30 per cent increases. In 2012-13 it is $1,864 a megalitre--three times the price it was in 2007-08. In 2012-13 the bulk water cost for consumers in South-East Queensland is projected by the Water Commission to be three times what it was in 2007-08. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105439"></A>
That bulk water cost will be borne by the retail entities that this legislation is setting up tonight. Those retail entities will have no choice but to pass that cost on to Queensland consumers. Indeed, they will be compelled to do that because of the pricing mechanisms included in this legislation that give the Queensland Competition Authority the responsibility of setting the price, just as it does with the electricity industry. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105440"></A>
Water consumers need to be prepared for those incredible increases in water prices, but they also need to be prepared to sheet the responsibility for them home to the Bligh Labor government because it is the government’s responsibility. It will not be the responsibility of the council owned entities that we set up tonight. I fully expect that in the days ahead we will stand in this House and debate just whose responsibility it is. I know full well that when that time arrives members of the government will try to blame the equivalent of the global financial crisis, which is the excuse that it tried to use when it increased the electricity price for the member for Brisbane Central’s constituents by 40 per cent in three years. It blamed the global financial crisis. The member for Brisbane Central did not stand up and complain on behalf of her constituents. Like the rest of the mindless backbenchers in this government, she just accepted the explanations of the current government that somehow or other it was everybody else’s fault. It is the mums and dads who live in the electorate of Brisbane Central who will feel the full effect of this government’s mismanagement. They will do that when they pay their water bills, just as they do now when they pay their electricity bills. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1105441"></A>
The government and the people of Queensland can be assured that we on this side of politics will never let the Labor Party forget that they were the ones that spent $2.5 billion on a waste water pipeline that is producing effectively nothing but that has to be paid for by the mums and dads in South-East Queensland. We will never let them forget the debacle of the desalination plant at the bottom end of the Gold Coast that has to pump desalinated water all the way to Brisbane with all of those associated costs. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SEENEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 We will never let them forget that that mismanagement has built into the water business in South-East Queensland a financial cost that is the direct responsibility of people like the member for Brisbane Central and the member for Toowoomba North and all of the other members who sat in their Labor Party forums and did nothing. For 10 years the Labor Party did nothing. It decided not to build the Wolffdene Dam and it decided not to build anything at all. It was not just a decision not to build the dam that was wrong; it was the fact that it did nothing else. It was paralysed by indecision until such time as Brisbane faced a water crisis that it then had to react to in a panic-stricken way that put layer upon layer of financial impost onto water consumers in South-East Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110257"></A>
While we will support the formation of these retail entities that will be set up by this bill tonight, we do so with a word of caution to the government that it will not be allowed to shift the responsibility for its 15 years of mismanagement onto these council owned entities. When Brisbane consumers come to fully realise the impact of that financial mismanagement on their water prices, we will ensure that it is the government that is held to account, that it is the government that is seen to be responsible--not the retail entities that will be set up tonight and not the local governments that own them. Be very clear: the bill before the House tonight will not be allowed to be a blame-shifting exercise. It will not be allowed to be an exercise that allows the Bligh Labor government to shift responsibility for those financial imposts--those enormous water pricing increases that are coming--onto the local governments that will own these retail entities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110258"></A>
Let us look at what the entities involve. As I said at the beginning of this contribution, what we consider tonight is a model that was put forward by the councils themselves. It was put forward by the councils themselves because they realised and they pointed out to the government that the model that the government was pursuing was going to add another layer of financial madness onto the water pricing system in South-East Queensland. The councils could see and understand the cost of the government’s proposal. The councils came up with a proposal of their own to try to make the best of a bad situation that had come about since the water reform process was put in place in 2007. The councils proposed a model that consisted of three separate, commercially focused, vertically integrated businesses incorporating both the retail and distribution responsibilities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110260"></A>
That is the big difference. That is the difference between what the councils have proposed and what is included in the bill tonight and what the government proposed and what would have cost Queensland water users a heck of a lot more. The entities that this bill sets up tonight will have both a retail function and a distribution function. They will own the distribution network and they will retail the end product--the water--to the water consumers. Retail functions would be separated within the entities, but the entities would have responsibility for both the retail and the distribution.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110261"></A>
The entities will be established and will assume operational responsibility for water and wastewater services by 1 July 2011 at the latest. The entities would be constituted by the water businesses from the councils of Brisbane, Lockyer, Somerset and Scenic Rim in the first instance; Moreton and Sunshine Coast in the second instance; and the Gold Coast, Redlands and the Logan councils in the third instance. At this time Ipswich council is considering its position in the proposed model. The entities are to be managed by a board comprising a minimum of three members appointed by the owners. They will also comprise an independent chair with a majority of independent members, with councils having the option to appoint councillors or council officials. Appointment procedures will be determined by the owners having regard to the number of owners and the size of the interest held by each. Council sought to have a reserve power similar to the power that shareholding ministers have over government owned corporations. The entities will be required to report regularly to their own councils in accordance with the establishment documents.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110263"></A>
I believe it is important--and I know there is some resistance from the government to the concept of councils being able to appoint a councillor to the board--that these councils are able to appoint a council representative to the board. We all know that the government will appoint plenty of its own to the boards. It will appoint plenty of Labor Party hacks to these boards. It is important that the councils that are the owners of these entities and will have the eventual responsibility for their operation are able to appoint a council representative. It will be interesting to see the economic regulation that will be applied and how it will work in relation to the retail entities. It is proposed that the water entities will set prices from 1 July 2010, with a price monitoring function being filled by the QCA by a submission from each entity demonstrating that prices align with the costs associated with meeting the entity’s asset management plan and customer service standards.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110265"></A>
There can be no doubt that the biggest impact on the prices that these entities must charge will be the bulk water prices that I have already referred to--those bulk water prices that are already grossly inflated and will be further grossly inflated as the full effects of the government’s mismanagement flow through the system. That bulk water price will, in the main, determine the price that these retail entities can charge Brisbane consumers. Responsibility for that bulk water price rests squarely and firmly with the Bligh Labor government and the actions that it took and that were taken by its predecessor in the Beattie Labor government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110266"></A>
The state and the councils have agreed to a transition framework to deal with establishment costs with the state to fund any shortfall resulting from the smoothing of establishment costs during transition in order to avoid price shocks to customers. However, it would be fair to say that sunk costs incurred in the establishment of the distribution entity should be paid by the state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110268"></A>
There is a very important role for local governments in the planning and development process. The water assets arrangements under IPA and IDAS recognise the need for the owner of the water assets to have a primary control over infrastructure planning and development assessment decisions. The model before us tonight is one that the local governments have drawn up and decided gives them the best option of exercising that control.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1110270"></A>
The bill before the House tonight is only the first in a series of pieces of legislation that will be necessary to complete the water reform process to ensure that this model of council owned entities that have responsibility for the distribution and retail activities can properly operate. We will consider in this House a number of other pieces of legislation which will fill out the detail. This legislation tonight simply allows the entities to be set up for the process to begin. In that respect, we will lend our support to its passage through the House.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1114998"></A>
The bill also deals with the Aurukun and Mornington shire leases and extends those leases until 2059. These leases currently only run to 2029. The federal government’s funding from the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing is only available if 40-year subleases are available to Indigenous housing applicants. The LNP welcomes the move in the bill tonight but strongly urges the Labor state government not to allow this extension of time to delay moves towards freehold in these communities. It is our contention, it is our policy, it is our belief that these people need a system of freehold that allows them to invest in their own homes and establish those homes as their main asset, just as every other Queenslander has the right to do. We have always believed that freehold is preferable to leasehold. It is a major difference in political philosophy. We will continue to ensure that all Queenslanders, wherever possible, can enjoy the benefits of freehold title. </Hansard-Body>

The bill also allows for water supply investigation costs to be retrospectively recovered. This part of the bill has been instigated by the need to retrospectively recover the cost of the fluoride investigation at the North Pine water treatment facility. The retrospective claiming of the cost of that investigation is, I believe, questionable at best. However, it is reasonable to argue that there should be an avenue for the government to recover investigation costs. It is, though, disappointing and very questionable that the bill before the House should do that retrospectively. We have always expressed a deal of caution about legislation that acts retrospectively. In this case it was the government that should have taken responsibility for the fluoride bungle in the North Pine water treatment facility that caused so much angst and concern to so many Queenslanders. It was a clear failure of the state government, and the government should have been the one to take responsibility. While we support the part of the legislation that allows the reasonable recovery of costs, we put on the record tonight that we do not support the retrospective recovery of those costs in a situation where the government should have taken responsibility. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115007"></A>
The bill also deals with land valuations and extends land valuations to 31 August 2010. I have some doubts about the rationale given by the minister in his second reading speech as a justification for this. The government is always keen to ensure that the unimproved valuation of land is kept as high as possible because for them that maximises the income they receive from land tax. It is often confused with the role that local governments have of levying rates based on the unimproved capital values. I think, without exception, local governments adjust their rate in the dollar to take account for rises in unimproved capital value and therefore very seldom receive any net increase in the amount of money they receive when unimproved capital values rise. It is the opposite with the state government. It never adjust its rate in the dollar. It takes every opportunity to increase its rate in the dollar. It takes every opportunity to ensure that there is bracket creep within the land tax system and that increases in unimproved capital value result in higher land tax receipts for the government, and it takes no proactive action to keep those receipts constant in the way that councils do. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115009"></A>
The explanation that is given in this case is that the government is concerned that if a valuation was done it would result in higher valuations for people who are not in a position to pay. I have listened to the explanation that was given by the minister and by the bureaucrats at the briefing we received. I understand the proposition that is being put that somehow or other in the particular areas that this applies to there have not been enough sales since the market plateaued or began to fall to adequately provide a fair valuation that would reflect today’s values rather than the high values that were characteristic of land sales before the global financial crisis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115010"></A>
While I express concern about this particular part of the legislation, I am not going to oppose it tonight. I will watch with interest and wait to see the government implement some valuations that properly reflect the changes in land values not just in these areas but right across the state, because I think there has been a marked change in property values. Those property values should be reflected in the unimproved capital value, even if that results in a falling state revenue from the land tax regime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115011"></A>
The bill also allows for renewable energy projects to be built on state leasehold land. Of course, we would welcome the provisions in this bill that allow leaseholders to apply to extend the terms of their crown lease to allow renewable energy projects to be built on the land. It is a situation not dissimilar to the Aurukun and Mornington Island leases I spoke about earlier. Leaseholders are going to need a secure land title if they are going to be able to finance those types of projects. Wherever those projects become viable, they should not be constrained and their construction should not be constrained by land title issues. So we would welcome that part of the bill that allows for the leases to be extended and the renewable energy projects to be established on leasehold land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115014"></A>
As I said, the bill before the House is only the first in a series of bills that will deal with this process of finalising the water reform process that was begun some years ago in response to the water crisis that was a direct responsibility of the mismanagement of successive Labor governments. We will not oppose the passage of the bill before the House, but we will also never let this government use the passage of such legislation to absolve itself of the responsibility it has for the crippling price rises that are coming for water consumers right across South-East Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115017"></A>
I know that people in local government in South-East Queensland who will be the owners of these retail entities are very aware of the danger of being put in a position where they are left to shoulder the blame for the Labor government’s failure. We will assist them to ensure that never happens. The government will take responsibility for water price increases. The government will take responsibility--the minister, the Premier, the Treasurer and every member of the government will take responsibility--for the 300 per cent water price increases that the people of South-East Queensland will pay, just as the government should take responsibility for the increases in the power prices that have impacted on people across South-East Queensland in the last three years and that are also set to continue. That is the rider that we put on supporting this legislation through the House tonight. We will support the legislation, but we will also never let the government forget that it is the one that is responsible for the financial impost that the people of South-East Queensland will have to bear for generations to come. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr DICKSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Buderim--LNP) (8.07 pm): This legislation addresses a number of issues. I intend to focus mainly on the proposed restructure of water distribution and retailing. This bill is designed to deliver the second stage of the government’s South-East Queensland water reform program. Stage 1 of the program led to the creation of the South-East Queensland water grid. It saw the establishment of three authorities to manage the supply, transport and treatment of bulk water. The government claims that the restructure of water was essential because water was not being managed efficiently by the 17 retail entities that were responsible for it across South-East Queensland. There was also of course the fact that the government had not planned adequately and Brisbane was in the grip of a drought. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1115024"></A>
The government’s view of how water was being managed did not take into account how effective were the various water managers. On the Sunshine Coast, AquaGen--the water authority jointly owned by Maroochy and Caloundra councils--was extremely efficient. Those councils, unlike the state government, had planned for future water needs and invested in infrastructure. As a result, the region AquaGen served had highly efficient, well-managed and cost-effective water supplies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124577"></A>
We are now considering this legislation that will cover stage 2 of the government’s so-called reform process that will see the establishment of three water distributor-retailer entities. It will allow for the transfer of property, assets, liabilities and employees from local governments to the new entities. Those new authorities will also play a role in planning and development assessment processes and trade waste approval processes previously handled by local government. The restructure provides for three new vertically integrated authorities broadly based around Brisbane, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast. This will give South-East Queensland a total of seven authorities managing water. The other four, established under stage 1 of the government’s reform program, are horizontally based--that is, they are responsible for bulk water supply, bulk transport, manufactured water and the water grid respectively. While this might appear on the surface to be a reduction in the number of authorities, when you consider the implications it is in fact extremely complex.</Hansard-Body>

Previously, a local authority like Aquagen was responsible for all aspects of water delivery in its region. Now we shall have one authority responsible for distribution and retailing but four others playing a role in either bulk water or treated water. Where is the increased efficiency in this model? As a former board member of Aquagen, I can vouch for its innovation and efficiency as a water manager. I challenge the government to show how the creation of these separate entities--whole new bureaucracies--will improve on the performance of Aquagen.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124580"></A>
In undertaking this massive restructure, why did the government not consider a fully vertically integrated model? This would have provided for regional authorities with responsibility for all aspects of water--including bulk supply, treatment and so on--in that region. The only additional authority that would be required would be the one managing the water grid. Such a model would have been much easier to implement and no doubt considerably cheaper. It would have required less regulation. It would have ensured those responsible for water management in each region controlled all aspects of supply and distribution. This would have gone a lot further to promoting water conservation and innovation.</Hansard-Body>

Mr DICKSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 You put a gun to their head. In asking the question, ‘Why is this particular model being adopted by the government?’ the answer that comes to mind is so that the water entities can be easily sold off to private enterprise. This government has already shown it is prepared to flog off the state’s assets in order to solve the economic difficulties it has created--and why should water be any different? I would be very interested to know what costs are involved in setting up the government’s new structure. I would be even more interested to know who will bear those costs. No doubt it will be the long-suffering Queensland community. I do not think most people mind having to pay more for water. It is a precious resource and needs to be priced accordingly. What people do mind is paying for more bureaucracy and regulation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124585"></A>
Under the current system, water rates are managed by local governments as part of their overall rates process. Once the new distributor-retailer authorities are fully established, they will be responsible for collecting rates and dealing with customer inquiries and complaints. These functions require staff, call centres, management and accounting systems. This will duplicate existing council systems, which will still need to be maintained. It is unlikely that sufficient staff can be transferred from council to water authorities to cover the requirements, to say nothing of costs like computer systems.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124586"></A>
Local authorities will be transferring their water and wastewater assets to the new water entities. Given that in this year’s budget the government withdrew the subsidies it used to provide to local government for water sewerage infrastructure, what are the cost implications for the new authorities? The new authorities will also be able to undertake ‘complementary functions’ like consultancy on a commercial basis. I am concerned about commercial ventures taking over from the core functions of these authorities, which should be the provision of water and wastewater services to the community. There is also the issue of the cost of providing such commercial services. Will they have to be accommodated within the existing staffing and resources, or will the authority be able to set up expensive consultancy services that may or may not be profitable?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124587"></A>
Local governments will be entitled to share in the profits of the water authorities in return for handing over their water assets. I would like to know what sort of return to local government is anticipated, given the investment made in those assets was paid for by ratepayers. What size ‘share’ of the profit will be distributed, bearing in mind that each entity has more than one council shareholder?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124588"></A>
Water and sewerage used to be basic services provided to residents by local government. The margins earned by governments from water rates went towards providing further services and infrastructure. Now councils will have to rely on unspecified profits from water authorities they used to own but no longer control. These new entities will have full power over water in their regions. This includes, under clause 12, the power to ‘fix charges and other terms for services’. We all know what has happened under the privatisation of electricity retailing in Queensland--an increase in costs to consumers. Will the costs of setting up these new authorities mean increases in charges to customers? I am sure it will.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124589"></A>
I think we are entitled to be cynical about this government’s real motive for this restructure. If the motive is not to set up water authorities for a quick fire sale, why the rush to implement it? Local governments have been given only until the end of April next year to reach participation agreements with the new distributor-retailers. That is a ridiculously short time frame, especially considering that the new entities do not even exist yet.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124591"></A>
Transfer schemes are required under the bill for the transfer of assets, liabilities, instruments and employees from local governments to the new water authorities. This will require a great deal of work by local councils to ensure they complete the due diligence and comply with the provisions of the act. It will also impose significant costs on councils which are required to complete the transfer scheme by September 2010 at the very latest. The transfer process gives considerable powers to the minister. Worse still, there is no provision for transfer decisions to be appealed, reviewed or challenged. That is typical of the government. The explanatory notes claim that this is because of the tight time frames and to ensure ongoing provision of water and sewerage services to the community. Again, why is there such urgency, unless the government has another agenda? Why is the minister so hell-bent on transferring assets from local government to these authorities unless the plan is to sell them off? Who will benefit from this complex and expensive new structure? Certainly not the ratepayers of South-East Queensland and their elected councils.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124595"></A>
The role of the new entities in the planning and development assessment process will be included in further legislation. Clause 77 of this bill provides for the transfer of development infrastructure from local councils to the distributor-retailers. I note that existing changes and agreements will be retained by local government, but we need to know exactly what role these new bodies will play in planning. It is hard to see a benefit in introducing yet another agency into the assessment and approvals process.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124597"></A>
This bill will also provide for amendments to the Land Act 1994. Those amendments will allow the government to approve access to state land for renewable energy projects such as wind farms. These are important projects when we are looking for alternatives to traditional energy sources. Currently, the act does not allow for secondary activities where land is leased for grazing and agricultural purposes. Clearly, a wind farm could work very well using grazing land or similar, and these changes are sensible.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124598"></A>
The amendments to the Valuation of Land Act 1944 extend the time frame for valuations under pre-amalgamation local government boundaries. This may not be the benefit to landowners that the government claims. The impact of the global financial crisis and adverse weather may in fact mean that land valuations have dropped in the past year. This means that landholders will be paying higher taxes, including land tax--and we all know how much that has gone up over the last few years--than they would otherwise have done.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124601"></A>
The proposed amendments to the Water Supply (Safety and Reliability) Act 2008 demonstrate this government’s lack of proper planning and management of water. We should not require retrospective legislation to clean up the mess after the responsible entity fails, as occurred in April this year. The fluoride overdose itself was bad enough. What if this ‘mistake’ had occurred in the treatment of recycled water? The health of Queenslanders could have been seriously at risk. I hope the minister takes that on board.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1124602"></A>
Now the government belatedly realises that its legislation has failed to provide for information sharing that will allow for proper investigation of such incidents. It also wants to recover costs from the responsible authority for noncompliance with the act. I would have thought a bigger issue was the fact that such a serious incident could occur in the first place and what it says about the way water is now being managed in this state. It is quite extraordinary that only now is there a requirement under clause 136 of the Water Supply (Safety and Reliability) Act 2008 for a customer education and risk awareness program about recycled water. We all knew what was coming there.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129539"></A>
This should have been self-evident to the government. It just shows how badly the government has handled such an important issue. The new clause in the act that allows for cost recovery including retrospective recovery of costs associated with the fluoride overdose incident is a classic example of shutting the stable doors after the horse has bolted. When it comes to public health, cost is not the issue. Government has an obligation to the community to ensure its policies do not endanger the health of Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

I have no issue with the use of fluoride in our water, but when these decisions are made they need to be implemented properly and not be rushed through. This particularly applies to recycled water. That is why I am concerned about the proposed restructure of water distribution and retail. It is being rushed through, which makes it liable to mistakes like the ones we have seen in the water supply bill. Local governments are losing control of an important revenue source and assets built up over many years. The liabilities are also being removed, but will they be better off? There is a lot of doubt about that. They are retaining ownership but not effective control. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129542"></A>
I want to return to my earlier comments. This model and the time frames being imposed suggest the government has more on its agenda than water reform. It is looking to sell yet another asset owned by the people of Queensland. There is nothing wrong with a restructure that will benefit all stakeholders. This bill needs a lot more scrutiny to ensure that it can achieve that aim. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129543"></A>
I think we need to get straight to the point of why this bill is being put together tonight. I think most people in this room are thinking what I am thinking and probably what most people in Queensland are thinking. This asset is going to get flogged off. I think the government should look very closely at what it put forward recently--after the election, not prior to the election. I make that point very strongly. It made decisions after the election that should have been talked about prior to the election, and that was the selling of core assets like ports, plantations, rail and roads. Is water the next thing that will be sold in Queensland? What price is going to be put on that?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129544"></A>
I want to talk about the price of water. This is bulk water and it is not figuring in the normal inflation rate. In 2008-09 a million litres cost $902. In 2009-10 they will cost $1,162. In 2010-11 they will be $1,409. In 2011-12 they will be $1,643. In 2012-13 they will be $1,864. If you break that down, that is $1.86 per kilolitre just for the purchase of bulk water in 20012-13. That is not the retail cost; that is just the bulk cost of water. How much is the real figure going to be when you factor in inflation? Is it going to be $2.50? Is it going to be $3? Is it going to be $4? I do not know the answer to that, but the government should come clean and articulate these prices to the people of Queensland. It appears as though the government does not understand it. It is putting documents out like this one here, which talks about these figures that are demonstrated very clearly in the footnote of this document--figures excluding normal inflation. Why can’t the government add up? Why can’t it factor in the cost of normal inflation? Is it two per cent or three per cent? It is not a big number. I think the government can work that out. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129545"></A>
I think the government has a real problem with adding up and numbers, because we have a debt of I think $85 billion. Had that money been spent on proper infrastructure throughout Queensland over the last 10 years, we would not have had a problem with water. Local authorities were doing a very good job, but this government was sitting on its hands when it should have been using its head and thinking about the problems of the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129546"></A>
There are a couple of quotes I could pull out of the bible. There was a story about seven good years and seven bad years. We had seven bad years and the government never planned. We had seven good years and the government still has not planned. When is the government going to start planning for the future? We need to be proactive, not reactive, when it comes to water. There are a lot of things in this bill that are very reactive. When we talk about the implementation of fluoride into the system, which I touched on earlier in my speech, that only killed a couple of budgies, knocked a few goldfish around and killed some daisies in somebody’s backyard. If the same thing happens with recycled water, what will the implication be? How many hundred thousand people could get sick? I know the minister has changed portfolios recently, but the next portfolio he will be looking after will be Health, because they will have to save a lot of people’s lives. What sorts of diseases will be passed on unless this law is implemented correctly? Fluoride was something that just slipped through the system. As I said, it only killed budgies, goldfish and a few plants. Let us talk about the people who could be killed or made very ill through the implementation of recycled water. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129548"></A>
It is not really recycled water, is it; it is treated sewage? It is the stuff that goes down the toilet in hospitals. It is the stuff that goes down the toilet in everybody’s households. They could be taking God knows what sort of medication. This will all go into the same catchment pit, go through the sewage treatment plants and then turn into this you beaut fluid that is called recycled water. What if the same mistake that was made with fluoride is made with recycled water? I know the bill is talking about how they are going to stop that, but it is retrospective. Let us remember that word--‘retrospective’. Hindsight is really good, but if you get it wrong just once what is it going to do to the people of Queensland?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129549"></A>
I also remember a minister in this government by the name of Henry Palaszczuk. I was a councillor with the old Maroochy Shire Council on the Aquagen water board. I was castigated in the newspaper when Henry said, ‘We will never build a pipeline to the Sunshine Coast. We will never take your water.’ I do not know what you call that. You are not allowed to say the word in this parliament. I would say it was a very poor investment in the truth. That is probably what we could call it. I really do not know what we are going to use as a replacement for that word any longer. Maybe from now on we will call it a poor investment in the truth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129551"></A>
We were misled at that time. I think we are being misled in this bill. I think we really need to look at this government’s form--its form before the election and its form after the election. If the government were a racehorse it would not win a race because it has bad form. It has form that you would not put in a race. You would not trust that form. When it gets down to this water grid and its implementation, I say very sincerely to the people of queensland and the members of this House: I would like a commitment from the government if you are going to sell the water or not. Minister, I hope in your speech tonight--</Hansard-Body>

 Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would pose a question to the minister and I would hope that he could answer that with a great degree of honesty tonight. Will the government be selling the assets in the future or not? Let us not speculate. Let us not skirt around the outside of the issue. Let us talk about the plain, simple truth. You could not do it before the election. You made decisions after the election. Now you have an opportunity to be honest and truthful to the people of Queensland. Will you be selling these assets or not? You had an opportunity to create four components of this water grid, but you have seven, which leaves me to believe it will be a saleable asset very shortly.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129559"></A>
I know there are many companies out there like Avendi waiting with bated breath to chew up our water supply. I can tell you one thing from my perspective: I will never support the selling of water regardless of whoever puts it up, so take that on notice. And the people of Queensland can take that on notice. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BATES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mudgeeraba--LNP) (8.27 pm): I rise to contribute to the South-East Queensland (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) and Natural Resources Provisions Bill 2009. The purpose of this legislation is to restructure the downstream water and waste water distribution and retail functions in South-East Queensland. It establishes three council owned distributor-retailer entities to take over the provision of water and waste water services. It also allows the recovery of reasonable costs of investigation into the water supply including retrospectively the cost of the fluoride investigation at the North Pine water treatment facility. It also allows the establishment of renewable energy projects on state leasehold land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1129564"></A>
In September 2007 the Queensland government approved a range of institutional reforms to be implemented across the South-East Queensland urban water sector. These reforms supposedly addressed a number of critical shortfalls in the urban water supply arrangement. South-East Queensland councils were asked by the government to recommend a model for these reforms. While the majority of this reform is acceptable to the councils, the South East Queensland Council of Mayors has expressed strong concern that councils are unable to appoint even one director despite the entities being council owned.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139314"></A>
The government claims that this is to avoid a burden on landowners already affected by the global financial crisis and extreme weather. However, in fact it may be that the previous valuations may be higher than the post GFC valuations. This will particularly impact on people’s land tax valuations in a time when residents are already struggling. The retrospective claiming of costs of the investigation of the fluoride bungle was questionable at best, as was the government’s pledge for a referendum before adding fluoride to our water and making us drink recycled sewage.</Hansard-Body>

The South-East Queensland water reform program was to be delivered in a two-stage process. Stage 1 focused on bulk water reform, in particular the establishment of these three statutory authorities to own the bulk supply, bulk transport and manufactured water infrastructure respectively and also the construction of the South-East Queensland water grid which connected the South-East Queensland region’s major water sources, water treatment plants and bulk water transport networks. The SEQ Water Grid Manager was also established to operate the South-East Queensland water grid and to be the single purchaser of bulk water services and the single seller of bulk water in South-East Queensland. Stage 1 became operational on 1 July 2008.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139319"></A>
Stage 2, which is to be operational from 1 July 2010, focuses on downstream water reform. The core of the stage 2 reform program is the separation of the retail and distribution functions from South-East Queensland local governments and the establishment of these three separate vertically integrated distribution retail businesses. The Liberal National Party believes that councils should retain ownership and control over their water supply and wastewater infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139320"></A>
On 1 July 2008 South-East Queensland’s bulk water supply and water transport assets were transferred to the state government. On the Gold Coast the transition included the Hinze Dam, the Little Nerang Dam and the Molendinar and Mudgeeraba water treatment plants--three of which are in my electorate. Hinze Dam is about 15 kilometres south-west of Nerang. The Hinze Dam, completed in 1976, was upgraded in 1989 to a storage capacity of 161,070 million litres covering a surface area of 972 hectares. Based on our average rainfall and our weather patterns in that area, it can provide on average 191 million litres of water per day. The Hinze Dam is currently being upgraded for flood mitigation and increased storage.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139323"></A>
The 207-square kilometre catchment area for Hinze Dam includes the Numinbah Valley and Springbrook Plateau--both of which are in my electorate--with about 77 per cent covered by native bushland within state forests and national parks. The Gold Coast City Council owns more than 5,000 hectares of land surrounding the Hinze Dam and the Little Nerang Dam. About 15 per cent of the catchment has been developed into pasture land, mostly in the Numinbah Valley where dairy and beef cattle properties operate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139324"></A>
Currently, the stage 3 upgrade of the Hinze Dam is in progress. The upgrade will raise the dam wall from 93.5 metres to 108.5 metres. This is designed to increase the water supply from Hinze Dam to 225 million litres per day and reduce flooding in the lower Nerang River catchment area and ensure the dam complies with current safety standards and guidelines.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139325"></A>
The Liberal National Party policy was to abolish the Water Commission and for the ownership and control of local water infrastructure and service delivery to be in the hands of local councils.

The residents of the Gold Coast are sick and tired of being treated like second-class citizens. Whilst we were on water restrictions for years, residents in Brisbane were hosing their driveways.

<A ID="pgfId-1139332"></A>
The Hinze Dam, the Gold Coast’s major bulk water supply asset, lies smack bang in the middle of my beautiful electorate. Over the past seven years I have watched it hit its lowest point, when the old stop signs and street signs were visible sticking up above the level of the water, and I have also watched the water go over the spillway when we have had good rain in good times. I have been relieved to know that, when the water level in the Hinze Dam was below 30 per cent, water security for my area was guaranteed by the supply of water coming from Wivenhoe Dam when it was full via a pipeline from Brisbane.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139333"></A>
One has to worry about this government taking control of our water resources when one of its own members was so confused she did not know whether there was a pipeline in her electorate. This is just another example of this government’s propensity to be loose with the truth.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1139334"></A>
Only this week the Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy joined with the Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability in perpetuating the myth that members of the Liberal National Party have no environmental credentials.

Mr CHOI</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Capalaba--ALP) (8.36 pm): I rise to participate in the debate on the South-East Queensland (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) and Natural Resources Provisions Bill. At the outset, can I thank the minister for proposing this bill to the House and for his extensive consultation with all of the mayors in South-East Queensland. I would like to address the amendment to the Land Act 1994 which will make it possible for renewable energy projects to be established on state land that is presently being used for grazing or other purposes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139346"></A>
The Land Act is the framework for the administration and management of leasehold land. Leasehold land makes up 70 per cent of all the land in Queensland, of which the majority is assigned to grazing and other agricultural leases. Under current Land Act provisions, a lease must be used for the purpose for which it was issued. The minister administering the act can approve an additional purpose for a lease but only if the additional purpose is complementary to and does not interfere with the purpose for which the lease was originally issued. A lease for grazing and agricultural purposes could have an additional purpose such as low-key tourism included in the lease. This purpose would be deemed to be complementary to the original purpose and would be of sufficiently small scale to ensure that the additional purpose does not become the dominant or principal activity.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139347"></A>
However, this approach has served us well, but we are now facing new climate change challenges. Equally, we are learning very quickly about both the damage we are doing through our carbon emissions and the ways we can improve upon our situation. This is the impetus for the clean and renewable energy revolution. Queensland needs to be a part of it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139348"></A>
The Queensland government has signed up to the national renewable energy target of 20 per cent of Australia’s electricity supply to come from renewable sources by 2020. This is documented in our <Hansard-Italic>
Toward Q2: Tomorrow’s Queensland</Hansard-Italic>
 green vision for protecting our lifestyle and environment. Our future challenges are mapped out in ClimateQ which positions Queensland at the forefront of Australia’s climate change response.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139351"></A>
The Queensland Renewable Energy Plan is our policy platform to expand the renewables sector. Queensland is rich in renewable energy sources--solar, geothermal, biomass, wind and hydro. The Queensland government is committed to accelerating the state’s economy towards a clean energy future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139352"></A>
Renewable energy projects such as wind farms require vast amounts of land to be successful. Renewables such as wind farms can quite easily coexist with leases which are currently being used for grazing and agricultural purposes. Currently as the Land Act exists, a lease must only be used for the purpose it was issued. Additionally, the minister can approve an additional purpose for a lease but only if the additional purpose is complementary, as I said before, to the original lease and does not interfere with the purpose for which the lease was originally issued.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139353"></A>
An additional purpose, such as for wind farms, would become in most instances the more dominant use of the lease and would currently not be allowed. The proposed change to the legislation will allow for an additional purpose, such as a wind farm, even though it would not be complementary to the original purpose, but only for situations where a green energy project is to be established on the leased land. This amendment will allow for proponents of renewable energy projects access to state land which was previously unavailable to them. We need to be leaders, at the front of the pack, showing renewable industries the world over that Queensland is the place to do business and that Queensland is the site for their future renewable energy projects. Given Queensland’s size and the abundance of our renewable energy sources, it is important that we support this legislation and give Queenslanders a chance to have a green and clean future. I commend the bill to the House. </Hansard-Body>

Mr STEVENS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mermaid Beach--LNP) (8.40 pm): I rise to add my contribution to the debate on the South-East Queensland (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) and Natural Resources Provisions Bill 2009. At the beginning I would like to highlight how this state Labor government has mismanaged the water supply in Queensland. It is a reactive government--not a proactive one--and an effective, efficient and clean water supply is a service that the taxpayers of Queensland deserve. That should happen without a hit-and-miss approach. It is the government’s duty to ensure a sustainable and affordable water supply to all of Queensland.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1139398"></A>
The genesis of this legislation, which the opposition will be supporting in a responsible manner, is the failure of this government to properly plan for the water supply in Queensland which started back in 1989 when I was a councillor on the Albert shire council. With a wonderful little stroke of brilliance during an election campaign, Wayne Goss and Fred James came out and promised to do away with the Wolffdene Dam if they got elected. This was a dam that was planned to cater for the fantastic growth in the south-east corner. It was obvious that the water planners for Queensland knew the growth rates. Albert shire was the fastest growing local authority in Australia. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139400"></A>
This politically motivated election promise, which was made to get Wayne Goss elected, has resulted in a lack of an appropriate water supply for the fastest growing area in Queensland, and even in Australia--South-East Queensland. Because we have had no Wolffdene Dam, we have had to make this knee-jerk reaction to catch up all these years later. It was in 1989 when the Wolffdene Dam was cancelled. Here we are, 20 years later, debating legislation to pass the buck--the blame for this massive increase in the cost of water to South-East Queenslanders--to the poor local councils. We all know that this legislation will bring higher charges. Yet again, Queenslanders will be paying for this incompetent Bligh Labor government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139401"></A>
Does the ambulance levy spring to mind? Beattie made an unfunded promise to the pensioners of Queensland of a free ambulance service. That was a great idea--a free service--but it was unfunded. So what were we left to do? We were left to pick up the tab. Now we have an annual charge on our electricity bills. Originally, the Beattie government tried to pass on that charge to local councils so they would cop the blame. But the councils said, ‘No way. We will identify this as a state charge.’ This is what will happen to increases in the price of water. That blame for that will be passed on to the councils. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139402"></A>
We have seen the price of electricity go up. We have seen the price of gas go up. The cost of car registration has gone up. Fuel prices have gone up. Now we are seeing the price of water go up. The poor old Queenslanders are stuck with Beattie-Bligh Labor governments inflicting more costs on them every day. When I was a member of the Gold Coast City Council advising the mayor, I heard that the government was going to take over the wholesaling of water to councils. I said, ‘Watch out. That’s the biggest bear trap.’ At that stage the council was getting an $80 million profit out of its water operations. The only way you can make a profit on your retail price is dependent on the wholesale price. Of course, when this government is in charge of the wholesale price for water for Queenslanders, you can guarantee that it will be going up 30 per cent a year. That is exactly what will happen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139403"></A>
I would like to be there when the good Labor members over there go along to their respective union bosses--the ETU, the CFMEU, the AWU, whatever they are over there--and say, ‘We have to sell these assets, “Big” Bill,’ or whoever else is running their union, ‘because we didn’t plan properly for Queensland. We’ve overspent. We’ve got ourselves into financial trouble. We put in all of this water infrastructure, such as that lemon down at the Gold Coast for $1.2 billion, which has not been needed, and now we have to sell your public assets, Bill. I am sorry about that, but we have been incompetent.’ I would like to be at that meeting. That will be a fascinating meeting.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139404"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Messenger:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 ‘Big’ Bill rolled over, though. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139405"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 He might have, but there are a few ETU members who have not rolled over. The members opposite have no idea how to manage infrastructure development, let alone the services that go with it. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139406"></A>
The objectives of this bill are to restructure the water and waste water distribution and retail management functions to improve water security planning and service delivery, enhance customer service delivery and accountability. These objectives will be achieved by establishing three distributor-retailer entities. They are based on location and neighbouring councils. Queensland Urban Utilities will be the largest and will encompass the local councils of Brisbane, Ipswich, Somerset, Scenic Rim and Lockyer--the wonderful Lockyer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139408"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Down>
Mr Rickuss:</Hansard-Member-Down>
 Yes.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139409"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 The second entity will include the councils of the Sunshine Coast and Moreton Bay. The third entity will cover my beloved Gold Coast, Logan, a former part of the old Albert shire and the Redland council--the great Redlands with its wonderful natural water supply. Now, the wonderful people of the Redlands will have a very dear water supply because of this government’s failure to plan properly and passing on these high costs to them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139410"></A>
The second and third retail entities will have to be in place by 2010, and each of the three entities will retain joint local government ownership but will each have their own board of directors. Queensland Urban Utilities will operate the water retail and water distribution unit of the Brisbane City Council and will supply water to more than 1.3 million people across Brisbane, Ipswich, the Lockyer Valley and the Scenic Rim and Somerset regions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139411"></A>
The responsibilities of Queensland Urban Utilities, which in July 2010 will become a statutory authority, are to purchase water from the state government South-East Queensland water grid manager--at an exorbitant price, no doubt--and deliver it to residents; to manage and treat sewage and operate sewage pumping stations; to manage and maintain $4.4 billion of infrastructure and assets, including water supply mains and sewer networks; to issue accounts for all water consumers whether residential or commercial users; and to provide a specialised recycled water service to businesses that require it. The other two water utilities will have similar responsibilities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1139413"></A>
The South-East Queensland (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) and Natural Resources Provisions Bill also seeks to amend the Land Act 1994, the Local Government (Aboriginal Lands) Act 1978, the Valuation of Land Act 1944, and the Water Supply (Safety and Reliability) Act 2008. The amendments to the Land Act 1994 will allow for preferential access arrangements for renewable energy projects on state government land. That, to me, seems reasonable, as the Liberal National Party supports any initiative that focuses on encouraging alternative methods and environmentally friendly methods of generating power and will adjust those leases that are currently for rural-only purposes to encompass generating power and renewable energy projects. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144748"></A>
The Local Government (Aboriginal Lands) Act 1978 will be amended to change and extend each lease for Aurukun and Mornington shire for a period of 31 years from the day that the lease would have expired. This occurs at clause 117 of the bill, where a new section 3A is inserted. This extension will allow for these communities to continue to apply for Australian federal government funding under the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing, as stated in the explanatory notes, and gain the ability to offer 40-year subleases to secure housing assets as required under the agreement. We support anything to help our good friends in these remote areas.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144753"></A>
I also want to discuss the amendments to the Valuation of Land Act 1944. Clause 127 of the bill seeks to amend the VLA to extend the date that the act can apply to pre-amalgamation local government boundaries from 31 August 2009 to 31 August 2010. This extension of one year is absurd and the amendment is a complete con. This corrupt, dishonest government will not make any effort to re-evaluate land because its land taxes will plummet. It is all about the financial aspects with this bankrupt government. It knows land prices have plummeted. What it is deliberately doing is keeping them at the old values and extorting more money out of those people. Everyone knows there was to be a valuation done every year. The government was happy to grab the money while the land prices were going up. Now that the prices are going down, it does not want a little hole in the budget. That is all this is about. The height of arrogance of the whole matter is the fact that it is still charging local governments a fee for the valuation every year. I am reminded that the Gold Coast City Council’s bill for its valuation was $600,000 per annum. It is still claiming that fee despite the fact that it is not doing a valuation. The ratepayers are paying for this government not to do a re-evaluation. Tell me the logic in ratepayers paying for this government to not do a valuation? Is that not that sensible? Their land valuations will stay higher rather than come back to the market situation which has obviously diminished.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144754"></A>
I am amazed how far this government will go to corruptly manage this state. With an enormous debt of $85 billion, it will do anything to keep its head afloat and save going down to that AA- credit rating, which is not far round the corner unless it commits more to those asset sales. It is having a lot of difficulty. I can smell in the wind that there is a change coming shortly in relation to those asset sales. That has put the hammer on this government. The polls are turning badly for it. I do not think Anna Bligh will be hanging around for too long if she does not change the public perception of those asset sales. It does not matter about facts and myths. People do not want a bar of the untruths that they were told.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144755"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I rise to a point of order. I question the relevance of the member’s contribution. He seems obsessed with the issue of asset sales. This is a water bill, not an asset sales bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144756"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER </Hansard-Member-Up>
(Ms O’Neill): I ask the honourable member to refer to the bill at hand.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144757"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr STEVENS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I am happy to move on. Obviously it is a very sensitive point. The Water Supply (Safety and Reliability) Act 2008 will be amended to improve the recycled water and drinking water regulatory framework as a result of the fluoride incident at the North Pine water treatment facility. The member for Buderim has already detailed quite a few aspects of this absolutely disgusting episode when the fluoride was 20 times more than the recommended amount. It was added to the water supply of 300,000 litres of water and distributed to 4,000 homes, and I feel very sorry for the little budgies and goldfish that the member for Buderim said died as a result of that poisoning of the water. What an absolute debacle this incident was. It shows us the way the government manages water and fiddles with our water supply. It is a matter way out of its control and which is often to the detriment of Queensland taxpayers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144758"></A>
The introduction of this bill reinforces the lack of management ability of this state Labor government. What is completely ironic is that when the state government decided to take over the control of water infrastructure and distribution it realised it could not manage it. Therefore, it wants to give it back to the councils that, as we know, are the ones that know how to manage and distribute water. The Bligh Labor government has botched the management of the water grid which blew out the budget and will result in the high cost of water that Queenslanders will now pay. Thank you very much, Bligh Labor government, for putting up water prices!</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144759"></A>
The desalination plant on the Gold Coast worth $1.2 billion is just sitting down there. I again remind all of my friends on the other side who love the green movement of the power generated to run that desalination plant. We know it is supposed to supply 125 megalitres a day. Unfortunately, I do not know how many it has produced at this point in time. It is sitting down there turning into $1.2 billion worth of rusty lemon. Again to the good union friends of those opposite: that is one of the reasons the government is selling its public assets. The cost of that desalination plant, of course, is incorporated into the cost of water that the taxpayers of Queensland will have to endure and see rise over the years ahead.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144760"></A>
I reinforce that the Bligh Labor government nearly always makes a decision after the problem or the crisis has arisen. There is no future planning. When it is in trouble with water, power, the ambulance service or the motorways, it puts up the prices for the users and comes with after-the-fact answers that are always very expensive and have put the state into the sad debt situation we are in. This legislation before us today is to pass the buck of increased costs over to the poor old councils in South-East Queensland. Who really pays in one form or another are Queenslanders in South-East Queensland. They are ratepayers; they are taxpayers. They are the same person! The same people will be voting out the Bligh Labor government because of those increases in the water prices that this legislation will lead to in the very near future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144761"></A>
This situation has happened in the running of one of Queensland’s most essential services--that is, water. I agree completely with the member for Buderim that this will be another item for asset sale in the very near future to balance the books and relieve that burden on that bank balance which is looking increasingly like forcing the government into a worse credit rating than it currently enjoys.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144762"></A>
When the government realised that it was unable to manage our water supply, it placed it back into the hands of the local councils that are the best ones to manage such a vital service to Queenslanders. They have done a great job managing the water supply over many years. They really are and have always been the best people to give a good, reliable, steady, clean, efficient water supply to areas such as Redlands, Brisbane and the Gold Coast. Unfortunately, this government will make them pay through the nose to keep going on that course. We support the legislation.</Hansard-Body>

Mrs STUCKEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Currumbin--LNP) (8.58 pm): I rise tonight to speak on the South-East Queensland (Distribution and Retail Restructuring) and Natural Resources Provisions Bill 2009. As honourable members have already heard from the shadow minister, the honourable member for Callide, we on this side of the House support the general intent of this bill. I thank the minister for making available departmental staff to brief the opposition on provisions within this bill earlier this week. It is interesting to note that this is the third reform to South-East Queensland water in four years. Firstly there was the Water Amendment Bill in 2006, which established the Water Commission. Then there was the Water and Other Legislation Amendment Bill and South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Bill in 2007, which gave the government the ability to purchase and control water assets.</Hansard-Body>
<DIV>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144793"></A>
The main purpose of this new bill before the House is to return the retail and distribution aspect of water to three council controlled entities. It would appear that the Bligh government was incapable of managing the water grid, with its complex systems and layer upon layer of bureaucracy established by the Beattie government. This bill’s main purpose will be effected by the creation of an act to further restructure the water industry in South-East Queensland and to make amendments to the following acts: the South East Queensland Water (Restructuring) Act of 2007, the Statutory Bodies Financial Arrangements Regulation 2007, the Land Act 1994, the Local Government (Aboriginal Lands) Act 1978, the Valuation of Land Act 1994, the Water Act 2000 and the Water Supply (Safety and Responsibility) Act 2008. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144802"></A>
The bill before us enables the establishment of three council owned distributor-retailer entities which will take over the provision of water and waste services from council. Notably, these assets will continue to be owned by council, but the functions of the assets will be transferred from individual councils to the three new entities along with the required staff members, and the number of entities will be reduced from 21 to seven. However, this is only the first bill in a two-step process. The second step will contain provisions for these new entities to become operational, and there is no mention of when a further bill to make these entities operational will occur. All three entities will be in place by 1 July 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144803"></A>
Once established, these entities will be known as water business 1, 2 and 3. Separately, these legal entities will be responsible for water delivery, waste water transport and treatment, recycled water treatment and supply, operations and maintenance, new infrastructure and retail services including billing and customer service. Water business 1, which covers Brisbane, Ipswich, Lockyer Valley, Somerset and Scenic Rim, will be owned by five council shareholders. Water business 2 will be owned by two council shareholders, being Sunshine Coast Regional Council and Moreton Bay Regional Council. Water business 3 will be owned by three council shareholders, being Gold Coast City Council, Logan City Council and Redland City Council. This business will service a population of some 850,000 people and an area of approximately 2,800 square kilometres and will have $4 billion in assets. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144808"></A>
Originally the government was looking at only one entity to oversee all of these areas. However, after much lobbying by the mayors of the Sunshine Coast and Moreton Bay, three entities were agreed upon. The mayors’ argument--and rightly so--was that one entity was unfair as it did not distribute the cost of the growth in South-East Queensland equitably and put the cost of water supply and sewerage growth in the western corridor onto Moreton and Sunshine Coast residents. It is a bit of rich of the minister to say in his second reading speech that he had challenged the mayors when it was they who led the charge. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144811"></A>
Queensland councils were, without doubt, short-changed when the Beattie government bought their water assets for peanuts and the Water Commission was established. After much debate and lobbying from councils, the government has decided to give back control of these assets through the creation of these water entities. Queenslanders have suffered through increased water bills because of this Labor government’s ill thought through decision to buy the water assets in the first place. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144813"></A>
Firstly, the government established the Water Commission and set up the South-East Queensland water grid. Next, it purchased water assets from the councils for a measly amount of money and water rates rose. The water grid is in chaos, the Tugun desalination plant has serious defects and here we have another piece of legislation to reform our water structure yet again. Let us hope this is more successful than those that have come before it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144814"></A>
Further water price increases are guaranteed as the three new entities will issue separate bills independent of their rate levies. It is my understanding that the bulk water rate will be set by government and all three entities will share in the cost of the water grid, including the Tugun desalination plant. It will be up to the individual councils to set how much they charge ratepayers for the use of water. The Queensland Water Commission has released figures of expected rises but qualifies this by stating that retail figures will be controlled by councils and, in doing so, absolves itself of any responsibility for a high cost to the consumer.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144816"></A>
In what is becoming repetitive and predictable behaviour by this Labor government, it has brought in legislation that, more often than not, places a heavy financial impost on local councils--those that are left, that is, after the shameful forced amalgamations across regional Queensland. We can therefore presume, just as was the case with the soaring electricity bills, that the price increase for water will be much greater than the government is letting on. Who can forget Premier Beattie’s deceitful announcement that electricity costs would not rise with privatisation and could be even cheaper? It is so easy for Labor leaders to make promises that they have no intention of keeping, so long as they get their face on the six o’clock news. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144817"></A>
Notably, Gold Coast bulk water prices per megalitre increased by $270 in 2008-09 and are predicted to increase by $256 in 2009-10 and by another $243 in 2010-11. This equates to an increase of $769 in a three-year period since the state government took over the water grid--and that does not include inflation. The expected retail bill increases for the Gold Coast are based on an average price which also excludes inflation and the fact that the new entities can set their own costs. These are projected to increase from $503 in the 2007-08 year to $807 in 2012-13, a jump of around 60 per cent. This, I imagine, would be the minimum increase that the people of Queensland can expect. Residents are the losers here while the Labor government attempts to cover its incompetence by shuffling our water supply from one entity to another. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144818"></A>
Due to the costly exercise of investigating the debacle at the North Pine water treatment facility, where there was an overdose of fluoride, the government is amending the Water Supply (Safety and Reliability) Act 2008 to enable it to recover costs. This will result in water service providers or recycled water entities who are investigated having to pay the cost of such an investigation--and so they should. However, this does not erase the fact that the government was responsible in the first place. Cost recovery provisions in the Water Supply (Safety and Reliability) Act will enable the government to recoup money spent due to these investigations. This is to ensure that water quality maintains a certain standard and any deviation from this can be readily identified and rectified without further cost to the government. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144821"></A>
According to the explanatory notes, the policy objectives of this bill are to deliver significant benefits to the community including improved South-East Queensland regional focus in water security planning and service delivery, enhanced customer interface and clearer accountability in customer service delivery. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144822"></A>
The Tugun desalination plant is a key component of the water grid, and I spoke about this project in November 2007 when debating earlier legislation. The state government took over this project from the Gold Coast City Council in 2006 promising to build a plant more than twice the size of the council’s model in a two-year time frame. This announcement was made within two months of a state budget that allocated just over $100 million for investigation, yet $1.2 billion was committed only months later. The rest, as they say, is history. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144824"></A>
It would appear that the unrealistic construction period demanded by the Beattie and Bligh governments has seen problem after problem, defect after defect, excuse after excuse and disruption after disruption. This two-year project is now well into its third year and it is not expected to be commissioned until mid-2010. As I said, this is a key part of the water grid. There have been faulty water pipes and water valves with signs of corrosion, pipes have caused roads in Tugun to literally pop out of the ground, numerous houses have suffered damage and the Tugun football club is sinking. All of this has hindered the opening of the facility. WaterSecure, the government’s own entity, handed its report to the Bligh government in July of this year highlighting major problems with the desalination plant. However, it did not include damages caused to residents’ homes or to the Tugun football club. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144827"></A>
We have heard every excuse imaginable from king tides, faulty valves, electrical problems, dry weather--and still the plant is not operating properly. During budget estimates this year, the Minister for Infrastructure had the hide to claim that the plant was finished and functioning properly. Now we learn that the monitoring of water quality of our ocean around the outlet pipe has been stopped due to budgetary concerns. The monitoring included photographs of various marine life, documented sites of marine species and water sampling, which revealed a lack of flathead and whiting around the outlet structure when the plant was undergoing trial operations. Environmental concerns about brine output from the plant into the local marine habitat existed from day one of this project, and recent reports from local fishermen indicated that close monitoring is required. It is to be hoped that the relevant minister will take some notice of this issue. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144828"></A>
Of even greater concern is what we are drinking from our taps in suburbs throughout the electorate of Currumbin. Supposedly, desalinated water is going into our drinking water in South-East Queensland, yet just how much has never been disclosed by the Bligh government. When my office contacted WaterSecure, a spokesperson who manages the facility could not even provide my staff with information on the capacity that the plant is running at or what percentage of desalinated water is being mixed with the normal water. I ask the Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy whether even he knows what is in our pipes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1144832"></A>
My office is receiving calls from people who are concerned about the water quality coming from the desalination plant and the fact that it is causing dry and irritated skin. How do we know what is in the pipes that bring water into our homes and what recourse do they have for resulting skin problems? Will these concerns be investigated? I would ask the minister: who will pay for these investigations and who will pay if there are serious concerns affecting people? When the plant is fully commissioned it is expected to produce 125 megalitres of desalinated water per day. But when this will occur, as is so much the mantra of this government, is anyone’s guess. </Hansard-Body>
