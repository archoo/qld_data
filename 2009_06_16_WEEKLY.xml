<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Mr NICHOLLS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Clayfield--LNP) (9.31 am): Mr Speaker, last sitting week I raised concerns about the failure of the Treasurer and the government to present appropriation bills for unforeseen expenditure. I also sought information from the Treasurer in question time. The Treasurer made reference to the Financial Accountability Act and indicated that, because the LNP supported that act, we were somehow complicit in the government’s failure to present the bills. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999315"></A>
The Financial Accountability Bill was first introduced on 4 December 2008 but lapsed on the dissolution of the 52nd Parliament. The bill was reintroduced on 22 April 2009. There is no reference in the Treasurer’s second reading speech for either bill about the change in unforeseen expenditure procedure. Page 3 of the explanatory notes to the second bill refers to nine major policy areas to be changed. None refers to the changes in unforeseen expenditure process. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999392"></A>
This compares to the 2006 amendments to the Financial Administration and Audit Act. The explanatory notes to that act stated that the timing of parliament’s consideration of Appropriation Bill (No. 2) would not be affected. A comparison between the old act and the new act shows only minor drafting changes in this area, and nothing in the new act apparently authorises any changes to unforeseen expenditure processes. Furthermore, the relevant portions of the new act do not come into effect until 1 July 2009--too late to have any relevance for the 2007-08 unforeseen expenditure. I also addressed these sections in the second reading debate on 19 May, when I said--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-999505"></A>
It is impossible during the year to assess how well the government is performing in terms of achieving its proposed agenda and to hold the government accountable. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999531"></A>
The Treasurer did not respond to my comments at any stage during the debate on that bill. Mr Speaker, these comments add to my concern and will be the subject of further reference to you. </Hansard-Body>

Mr SPEAKER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Honourable members, standing order 233 lays down a clear principle and rules in respect of matters pending in courts exercising a criminal jurisdiction. The matter should not be referred to in motion, debate or question from when the charge is laid to the determination of an appeal, if any. I cannot allow any petition, motion, debate or question which, if said outside, may constitute a contempt of court or which could in any way jeopardise a fair trial. Accordingly, in line with previous rulings--that is, Speaker Reynolds’s ruling on 6 February 2007--I have today instructed the Clerk to not present a petition touching upon a matter currently before the courts until that matter is resolved pursuant to standing order 233.</Hansard-Body>

Capital Works Program</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999762"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.35 am): The Queensland government’s budgeted capital program has more than tripled, from $5.3 billion in 2003-04 to almost $17 billion this financial year. In tough economic times, this building program means jobs for Queenslanders. This year alone our building program supports around 119,000 jobs from the cape to Coolangatta. The building program is also important to help us position Queensland for the future, to ensure that we emerge from the global financial crisis stronger, not weaker. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999865"></A>
Having the right infrastructure such as roads and other transport links in the right place and working efficiently means that we are better placed to support Queensland’s population growth. A growing population helps expand our economy and improves our skills base, positioning Queensland for future opportunities and future prosperity. That is one of the reasons my government’s Q2 targets include a strong economy with infrastructure that anticipates growth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-999937"></A>
The challenge of keeping pace with growth continues as Queensland’s population continues to boom. New ABS data released this month confirms record population growth in the 2008 calendar year. Our growth of more than 106,000 additional persons in 2008 was the largest in the country, and our growth rate of 2 per cent was well above the national average and second only to Western Australia.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000009"></A>
What this means is that Queensland’s population grew by more than 2,000 people per week in 2008. This is the first time on record that Queensland’s population growth has exceeded 2,000 people per week in a calendar year, and there is no other state growing at this pace today. Importantly, Queensland’s population growth has doubled in 10 years from less than a thousand people a week in 1998 to more than 2,000 people a week in 2008. This makes our commitment to Queensland’s record building program all the more important. It means we will have the roads, schools, hospitals and public transport that we will need for the future. It not only means jobs today but it means prosperity for tomorrow.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Coal Industry</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000150"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.37 am): Without a doubt, 2008-09 has been a difficult time for the coal industry in Queensland. The global financial crisis has flattened demand from partners such as Japan, China and India, and we have seen devastating job losses in mines across the state. Just last year these mining areas were enjoying an almost unprecedented boom and were experiencing an era of prosperity that it seemed would never end. Of course the boom did end, and it ended more quickly and more completely than anyone in the industry could have imagined or predicted. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000249"></A>
The effects of the global financial crisis have brought uncertainty to regions that just 12 months ago were bursting with optimism and self-confidence. But we are also seeing signs that despite this bruised confidence the Queensland coal industry is dusting itself off and getting ready to come back bigger, better and stronger than ever before. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1000299"></A>
The Waratah Coal proposal to create Australia’s largest thermal coalmine in Central Queensland and provide up to 45,000 jobs has now entered a new phase. It is exciting to note that this $6.55 billion plan to mine 1.4 billion tonnes of coal in the Galilee Basin and build a 490-kilometre rail line to Abbot Point coal port is now back on track. Members will recall that the original plan was to carry the coal through Shoalwater Bay at a new coal port, but this was rejected by the federal government for environmental reasons.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003388"></A>
The new route north through the established Abbot Point coal port means the application can now be reassessed. The proposal has already been declared a project of state significance, so my government will be doing everything we can to ensure there is an answer one way or the other as soon as possible. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003389"></A>
The confidence in the continued demand for Queensland coal that is driving the Waratah project is not the only green shoot for our state’s coal industry. Just last week I welcomed Direct Invest’s decision to bankroll a new $250 million coal development at the Cameby Downs Mine in the Surat Basin. Direct Invest’s subsidiary company Syntech Resources also plans to invest as much as $2 billion in a next-generation coal-to-liquids conversion plant in the same region. A prefeasibility on that project called SunState will be completed very soon. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003397"></A>
The $250 million Cameby Downs Mine project is located between Miles and Chinchilla and will begin construction in July, with the aim to export 1.4 million tonnes of thermal coal a year by 2010. So starting construction in July--</Hansard-Body>

 I find that remark offensive because it is incorrect. My comment was that there is no room for the trucks to get through the main street of Toowoomba now as it is gridlocked. The Premier turned that around to us not supporting the project. What we need is a bypass so that the trucks can get down to the export port, Mr Speaker. </Hansard-Body>

Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Whatever the member found offensive I will happily withdraw. This is a very important project for the Surat Basin. It will not only bring prosperity to towns like Miles and Chinchilla but it will also bring prosperity to the city of Toowoomba. What it means in the first stage is a coalmine that will export 1.4 million tonnes of thermal coal by next year. The second stage could boost export capacity to 20 million tonnes a year and is scheduled for completion by 2013. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003407"></A>
I draw the attention of those opposite to a project called the Southern Missing Link. If they have not heard of it, I suggest they get briefed on it. It is being operated by a consortium run by Everald Compton, who I understand is well known to members opposite. I would suggest that they get a briefing from him. I will enjoy telling him of their lack of support for it. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003415"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Whatever he finds offensive I withdraw. As I said, the first stage will create 100 jobs during construction and 100 jobs during production, while the second stage could create up to 600 jobs. The SunState project looking at the next-generation coal-to-liquid conversion manufacturing plant could employ up to 1,000 people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003416"></A>
This is a very significant investment in a part of our state that has been hit by drought and has had a depressed economy for a number of years. The project has the complete support of this side of the parliament. Both of these projects are a shot in the arm for anybody involved in our minerals and coal sector and are a very welcome sign of new jobs on the horizon. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Connell, Mr C</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003420"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. AM BLIGH</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (South Brisbane--ALP) (Premier and Minister for the Arts) (9.43 am): In the same week that the 2009 Queensland Greats were announced, another great Queenslander, Cyril Connell, passed away aged 81. On behalf of the government and all members of this House I extend my condolences to Mr Connell’s family. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003421"></A>
While loyal Broncos fans are well aware of Cyril’s 20-year contribution to his beloved club and the code of rugby league, I would like today to pay a tribute to his exceptional contribution as an educator in Queensland for a period of more than 30 years. Cyril was both a primary and secondary teacher and progressed to be principal of both Hervey Bay and Cavendish Road state high schools in the 1970s. He was an inspector of schools, a regional director of the south-west region in 1975 and finished his career as deputy director of secondary education in 1988. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003422"></A>
Without doubt, Cyril was ahead of his time in his approach to student welfare. In the 1980s in Brisbane he established the first education centres for students disengaged from formal schooling. While this is a more common approach to managing disengaged children and young people now, it certainly was not then. Through these education centres he worked to help children return to school or prepare for work and he worked with local business and industry to find them jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003423"></A>
Cyril knew that sport was a highly effective way of re-engaging children in learning, and he knew how to help children and young people translate sporting success to success at school and in life. It is little wonder that Cyril was held so dearly by the Broncos and the Broncos club. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003424"></A>
The other consistent attribute of Cyril Connell, admired by all who knew him, is that he never had a bad word to say about anyone. Notable is one ABC Radio broadcast he did of a match between two Queensland rugby league teams that had a 40-plus to nil score line. Cyril systematically worked his way through every member of the losing team and pointed out the things they had done well. Just as he had with children struggling with school, he saw the positives and the things they could build on.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003425"></A>
Put simply, Cyril Connell improved people’s lives. He dedicated his own life to it. He was an outstanding and much loved Queenslander and an exceptional human being who made a real difference to our community and to our state. As I said, I believe all members of the parliament will join me in expressing our condolences to his family.<Hansard-Speech-End>

 (Lytton--ALP) (Deputy Premier and Minister for Health)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(9.45 am): Before I commence my ministerial statement can I associate myself with the remarks of the Premier about Cyril Connell. Not only did he support young footballers in terms of their football; he supported them in their non-football lives--their careers, family support et cetera. I suspect if we had many more Cyril Connells involved in football competitions at the moment we would have a lot fewer of the problems we have suffered in recent times. </Hansard-Body>

Queensland Health has received a massive boost in funding in the last several years. The 2008-09 Health budget was a huge $8.35 billion--the fastest growing budget in the country, and up 64 per cent since 2005. We are halfway through the Queensland government’s $10 billion, five-year Health Action Plan--the largest single injection of funding ever to the Queensland health system. We are building and rebuilding hospitals across the state through the largest health infrastructure program in Australia.</Hansard-Body>

Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 He is being very bombastic. Since September 2007 we have employed 608 more doctors and 1,945 more nurses in Queensland public hospitals. This financial year our hospitals will have seen more than 850,000 admissions--that is 125,000 more compared to 2005-06. Our hospitals will have provided emergency treatment to more than 1.58 million Queenslanders, nearly 300,000 more than in 2005-06. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1003448"></A>
During the first nine months of 2008-09, our 23 largest EDs saw 749,622 patients and treated 88,132 patients from elective surgery waiting lists--an increase of 4.5 per cent on the same period the previous year. Including patients treated through our successful Surgery Connect program, this increases the figures from 85,163 in first three quarters of 2007-08 to 92,528 in the same period this year--an increase of 8.6 per cent. That is more than 7,300 extra patients who received their elective surgery in the first nine months of this financial year. But the Queensland government is also committed to screening programs that will make Queenslanders Australia’s healthiest people by 2020.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004958"></A>
Up until 31 December 2008 Queensland Health screened more than 206,000 women for cervical cancer and this financial year we are expecting to screen more than 216,000 women for breast cancer, up from 211,000 in 2007-08. But we know we need to do more, and we will. The opposition wants to know where the money has gone. I will tell it where it has gone: it has gone towards providing more hospital beds, more doctors and nurses and more services for Queensland patients.</Hansard-Body>

 The member for Maroochydore is absolutely right to be embarrassed. When the member for Maroochydore was last in government, she delivered a fraction in road and transport funding on the Sunshine Coast compared to when we were in government, and then when she was in opposition the best she could do was to deliver a railway line that did not go anywhere and did not connect to anything.</Hansard-Body>

Hon. AP FRASER </Hansard-Member-Electorate>
(Mount Coot-tha--ALP) (Treasurer and Minister for Employment and Economic Development) (9.50 am): Two key sets of data over the last week encapsulate the challenges ahead. Figures released on Friday night by Consensus Economics confirm that Queensland’s major trading partners have continued their downward slide as a result of the global economic downturn. The global economy’s downward trend will mean tough choices need to be made in today’s budget. The June Consensus GDP forecast released on 13 June had Queensland’s major trading partners collectively contracting by 2 per cent to the end of the financial year, a world away from the 0.4 per cent of positive growth predicted just in January. The economies of Queensland’s major trading partners are heading backwards. Our No. 1 trading partner, Japan, is expected to contract by over six per cent. Germany, Italy and the Netherlands are all expected to contract by well over four per cent. It is an inescapable fact that Queensland’s revenues and our fortunes are directly connected to the global economy and they have taken a big hit because of the performance of our major trading partners. This is on top of the massive drops in transfer and mortgage duties, while GST payments have also slumped by the billions.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004984"></A>
The starker numbers, however, are the effects of the downturn on jobs. Last Thursday the ABS released labour force statistics for the month of May. These figures reveal the stark reality of the global economic downturn’s impact on employment and its impact on economic growth. The state’s unemployment rate rose in May this year to 5.2 per cent, its highest rate since August 2004. While still historically low, the movement remains relentlessly upward, as it does across the nation. We are still half a per cent below the national rate, but the forecasts are universal in their trend. These are the numbers that frame our budget--a global recession and our trading partners in recession, delivering higher unemployment as the economy bears the brunt from the fallout. Our resolve to create jobs, support jobs and keep on building remains firm against the tide of destruction from the global recession. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. RE SCHWARTEN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Rockhampton--ALP) (Minister for Public Works and Information and Communication Technology) (9.52 am): At the outset, let me pass on my condolences to the family of Cyril Connell, one of Rockhampton’s proudest sons and a very good friend of my father and myself.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004991"></A>
I am pleased to inform the House of significant progress in delivering Queensland’s social housing initiative under the Australian government’s $42 billion Nation Building--Economic Stimulus Plan. The Department of Public Works is working with private builders and developers to deliver approximately 4,000 new social housing dwellings for the Department of Communities. Developers large and small, building contractors and trade contractors such as electricians, plumbers and carpenters all stand to benefit. This program means jobs, jobs, jobs in virtually all parts of the state. Proposals for over 1,600 dwellings have already been approved by the Australian government, with development teams now working to complete construction of 500 dwellings by 30 June 2010 as part of the $138 million stage 1 rollout.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004996"></A>
I am pleased to advise that by early July over 90 dwellings will be under construction, with this number to increase to approximately 200 by the end of July. Along with all of this new construction, the Department of Public Works is also managing over $40 million worth of additional repairs and maintenance to existing social housing under the nation building plan. Contrast that with the tories when they were in government federally. So far, more than 11,000 maintenance and upgrade work orders are in progress, with an additional 7,000 completed. The $40 million allocated to Queensland by the Australian government for 2008-09 has either been spent or has been committed.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1004999"></A>
In addition, the Department of Public Works is working closely with the department of education delivering the Building the Education Revolution program by leading the development of the overall procurement framework and models of delivery. While Nation Building work is being progressed, my department is also continuing to deliver the government’s commitment to the supply of 673 units of housing funded by the Queensland government costing $124 million in social housing projects in 2008-09 and beyond, and I see a smile on the Minister for Community Services’ face with the impending budget today. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059294"></A>
In May eight new dwellings commenced construction to the value of $1.7 million and over $14 million for social housing projects were approved to commence in the coming month. Not only is this work creating jobs in these building companies; it is also creating jobs in the supply chain. The Department of Public Works is continuing its history of delivering quality social housing projects on time and on budget and is well down the path of delivering over $1.2 billion worth of housing for people in need in Queensland. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. S ROBERTSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Stretton--ALP) (Minister for Natural Resources, Mines and Energy and Minister for Trade) (9.55 am): Over the last five years there has been record spending on improving the reliability and strength of Queensland’s electricity network. Since I commissioned the Somerville report in 2004, successive Labor governments have directed billions of dollars to be invested in order to provide Queenslanders with a system which can cope with the growing and increasingly energy-hungry population. In the 2003-04 financial year, Queensland spent just over $1 billion a year upgrading and maintaining the network. In only five years, investment by Ergon, Energex and Powerlink into our transmission and distribution network has doubled to more than $2.1 billion this financial year. Between 2005 and 2010, more than $9.4 billion will have been spent on expanding and maintaining the electricity generation and distribution network, creating thousands of jobs along the way. Despite these tough economic times, these three government owned corporations will continue to invest billions of dollars into the network every year to ensure the security of our network is not compromised despite our growing and increasingly energy-hungry population.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1005007"></A>
The Bligh government and indeed all Queenslanders would expect nothing less of these GOCs. This investment comes at a cost, and last week the independent Queensland Competition Authority released its final decision on notified electricity tariffs for 2009-10. I share the disappointment of Queenslanders that electricity prices will rise significantly from 1 July. These are difficult economic times, and I understand many Queensland families are doing it tough. However, the decision by the Queensland Competition Authority to increase the regulated electricity tariff by 11.82 per cent represents the true or actual cost of delivering electricity to Queensland households no matter where they live. If Energex, Ergon and Powerlink do not receive the appropriate return for their investment, then insufficient funds will be invested in maintaining and expanding their networks. The result will be that very quickly Queensland will return to the pre-Somerville days of increasing levels of electricity supply interruptions and service unreliability. This would be clearly unacceptable to the community and this is not something as Minister for Energy I will allow to occur. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. GJ WILSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ferny Grove--ALP) (Minister for Education and Training) (9.57 am): The Bligh government is working closely with our federal government colleagues to deliver the historic Building the Education Revolution program. This huge investment in building and rebuilding our schools will stimulate the economy and benefit all Queensland students. Schools throughout the state will gain new school halls, new libraries, resource centres and upgraded and refurbished classrooms. This massive building program will also provide local workers with jobs and companies with new business in communities all over Queensland. This means jobs, jobs, jobs and more jobs for Queenslanders. My department is working closely with the government’s building advisers, the Department of Public Works, and the building industry. But if those opposite and their Canberra colleagues had their way, not a single Queenslander would see the benefit of this new infrastructure--no new jobs, no new classrooms, no new resources. They wanted to deny Queensland students new and improved learning environments and wanted to deny Queensland workers the jobs that these projects will create. Those opposite claim that this investment in infrastructure is a waste of money. They simply have not done their homework.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006625"></A>
Their claims that state governments are siphoning 20 per cent of funding in fees and charges are wrong. The money allocated to schools is spent on the project at the school. The private sector is delivering these projects. The money ends up in the hands of contractors, subcontractors and other businesses working on these construction projects, just as always intended. The costs of building these projects are the same as those costs that are involved in any construction project and they are being paid to private contractors, not to the state government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006626"></A>
Claims that the funding is being used prop up workplace health and safety maintenance issues are again wrong. The state government continues to address workplace health and safety issues at schools as a priority, just as it always has done. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006627"></A>
Claims that guidelines are being breached and that money is going to schools marked for closure are wrong. The federal government guidelines for BER clearly state that schools being amalgamated or relocated must spend the funding allocation at the new site. That is exactly what is happening to ensure that students from these schools being amalgamated are still able to reap the rewards. It also ensures that we create maximum work for local contractors.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006628"></A>
The Bligh government has worked closely with the federal government to make sure Queensland students and workers get the most out of this great opportunity. We all want the same thing: to see as many Queenslanders as possible benefit from this nation-building stimulus package. We are working with the federal government to support and create Queensland jobs and to invest in vital services like education. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. NS ROBERTS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Nudgee--ALP) (Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services) (10.00 am): As members may be aware, a serious incident occurred at Brandon, near Townsville, in the early hours of Friday morning involving police and the use of a taser device. This incident is currently being investigated by the Queensland Police Service’s Ethical Standards Command for the State Coroner, with CMC oversight. It is important that these investigations are allowed to run their course so that all the details of this incident are fully examined. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006635"></A>
However, issues raised during the Brandon investigation have prompted the government, in conjunction with the Police Commissioner, to commission a review of taser training and operational policies. The review will be undertaken by the Crime and Misconduct Commission in partnership with the Queensland Police Service. The current rollout of and training for taser devices will also be put on hold for a period of four weeks, pending the outcome of the review. Currently issued tasers will continue to be used by police officers in accordance with existing policies and procedures. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006636"></A>
There is no doubt in my mind that the addition of tasers to the range of use-of-force options available to our police officers has been beneficial. Since the general rollout began in January, tasers have been deployed 264 times. In 201 of those occasions, the mere presentation of the device defused the situation and allowed police to take control of the situation. In fact, one of the untold stories of tasers in Queensland has been that the device has prevented 30 people from self-harming or committing suicide. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006637"></A>
There is no doubt that the incident in Brandon was tragic for the family and friends of the deceased man as well as for the police officers involved. The review we are announcing will run parallel to the Ethical Standards Command investigation and will examine current policies and training practices. If during the review any matters are identified that warrant immediate change to policy and training then that will occur. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take that interjection from the honourable member for Inala. Thank goodness: it is a great step forward. These new turns from the Centenary Highway southbound to the Ipswich Motorway westbound and the Centenary Highway northbound to the Ipswich Motorway eastbound are currently operating on a temporary alignment. In the coming weeks, weather permitting, work on these right turns will be completed on their permanent alignment and the new multilevel, free-flowing Centenary Highway interchange will open. This will significantly reduce congestion, improve travel time reliability and deliver safety improvements for the 145,000 motorists who use the Centenary Highway and the Ipswich Motorway every day. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006646"></A>
The works carried out over the weekend were some of the most complex and challenging undertaken on this project, with eight separate traffic changes taking place. The full interchange works and upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway between Wacol and Darra are expected to be completed by December 2010. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006647"></A>
This project is yet another solid example of the Bligh government delivering for Queenslanders. The Wacol to Darra project is among a long list of projects that our government is delivering for the people of Queensland, including the Gateway Upgrade Project, the Bundaberg ring-road, the Houghton Highway bridge duplication project and works in Cairns and in the north-west. In fact, I am pleased to advise that, despite the global financial crisis, 28,000 jobs have been sustained or created over the course of the year through the record levels of investment we have put into our road transport infrastructure. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. TS MULHERIN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mackay--ALP) (Minister for Primary Industries, Fisheries and Rural and Regional Queensland) (10.05 am): Today I will table the first interim report of the Noosa Fish Health Investigation Task Force. Six separate syndromes relating to fish health at the Sunland Freshwater Fish Hatchery have been identified, but to date no definitive diagnosis has been found. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006654"></A>
Syndrome 1 refers to sudden deaths of multiple species between November 2005 and January 2006. The scientific subcommittee accepts that contamination from a spray event is a plausible explanation. Syndrome 2 refers to sudden deaths of silver and golden perch in October 2007. There is insufficient information available to explain this event. Syndrome 3 refers to spinning juvenile silver and golden perch in October 2007 and October 2008, and syndrome 4 refers to deformities of silver and golden perch in February 2008. In both cases the fish benefited from treatment with atropine, which counteracts organophosphate and carbamate compounds. The subcommittee accepts that these chemicals may have played a part, but the source and specific chemicals are not determined. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006658"></A>
Syndrome 5 has drawn the most attention. In July 2008 four Australian bass females produced deformed larvae, including many with two heads. These females were sourced from the Noosa River and spawned in a shed protected from spray drift. At this point, no explanation can be provided and investigations continue. Syndrome 6 refers to the sudden death of silver perch in December 2008. Again, there is no definitive explanation. Multiple factors including gill fluke infestation, chemicals, water temperature or oxygen levels may be to blame. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006659"></A>
The task force acknowledges that not finding a chemical does not rule out possible impact from a chemical. Two samples have tested positive for chemical contamination. Cypermethrin was found in one fish feed sample and low levels of carbendazim, atrazine and metolachlor were found in Cooloothin Creek, about two kilometres downstream from the farm. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006665"></A>
This is a complex investigation with no simple answers. Consequently, it should be no surprise that there are differences of opinion regarding this matter. Some within the task force believe the report does not go far enough in identifying chemicals as the cause of the problems, but overall the consensus is that it is not possible to provide a definitive opinion on the cause at this stage. Another interim report is expected in September, with the final report due next February. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1006666"></A>
Finally, there is good news today for small businesses and primary producers affected by the February floods. Our request to the federal government for further assistance has been successful. Recovery grants of up to $15,000 will now be provided to eligible small businesses and primary producers to assist in clean-up and restoration activities. These grants will be jointly funded by the Queensland and Commonwealth governments. I seek leave to table the interim report.</Hansard-Body>

 (Cairns--ALP) (Minister for Local Government and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(10.09 am): The Bligh government’s ambitious reform of the local government sector has delivered stronger and more sustainable councils with the financial and strategic muscle to meet future challenges. While the global financial crisis is having an impact on all levels of government and every Queensland home, local councils are in a stronger position than ever before to meet these challenges head-on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008293"></A>
The reform process, coupled with an unprecedented $880 million investment since 2006, or $3 billion since 1998, has put councils in the box seat to pull through the current economic storm. No-one is suggesting that the current global economic conditions will persist indefinitely, and when conditions do improve stronger local councils will be better positioned to capitalise on sustained growth in resources, tourism, agriculture and other sectors driving Queensland’s economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008294"></A>
Reform is about assisting councils to maximise their resources and their capacity to implement smarter policy. Communities state-wide are already experiencing the benefits. Post amalgamation, the Bundaberg Regional Council is finding it has more on-site expertise, which translates into increased professionalism and less money spent on consultants and contractors. The Gladstone Regional Council’s major fleet of graders, loaders and trucks is now working on a seven-day roster, boosting utilisation by 88 per cent. This is a huge win in productivity. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008296"></A>
Councils do not just build roads and collect rubbish; they provide a range of services for their communities. A stronger, smarter Somerset Regional Council has combined four separate library administrations into one. For ratepayers this means a bigger selection of books and services. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009919"></A>
The financial benefits of reform are as clear as they are compelling. In its first budget and just three months into office, Moreton Bay Regional Council delivered a $6.5 million saving. Operational savings across the first term of government are forecast to exceed $34 million. The Cairns Regional Council has already identified $7.3 million in cost savings across five years. The Queensland government made the tough decision to reform the state’s local government sector and this is already paying off. <Hansard-Speech-End>

(Stafford--ALP) (Minister for Infrastructure and Planning) (10.11 am): The issue of land development and tenure on Inskip Point is a matter that has come before this House on a number of occasions over the past 30 years. I understand that it may become a matter for consideration of the House again in the near future. The House should be aware that prior to my election to the parliament, Rainbow Shores Pty Ltd directly engaged me to provide consultancy services related to the development of Rainbow Shores stage 2 on lands at Inskip Point. </Hansard-Body>

To ensure transparency and so there can be no possible perception of any conflict of interest in my capacity as the Minister for Infrastructure and Planning, I will not take any part in decisions in the cabinet or in the parliament regarding the lands on Inskip Point insofar as they may relate to this company. Instead, my colleague the honourable Minister for Local Government will deal with all such matters. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. RG NOLAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ipswich--ALP) (Minister for Transport) (10.11 am): Despite the global financial crisis, the Bligh government is continuing its multimillion dollar busway infrastructure program creating thousands of jobs for Queenslanders. The Boggo Road Busway and Eastern Busway at the Princess Alexandra Hospital are currently underway. The $226 million Boggo Road project and stage 1 of the $141 million Eastern Busway are creating 2,825 direct and indirect jobs. Both are on schedule for opening by August. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008309"></A>
The Boggo Road Busway is expected to cut up to 10 minutes from some trips from the southern and eastern suburbs to the University of Queensland. A person can get on a bus at Eight Mile Plains and travel by busway all the way to the university. It is expected to take up to 600 buses off the road every day which means up to 13,000 passengers will use them daily. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008310"></A>
The next stage of the Eastern Busway, from Buranda to Main Avenue at Coorparoo, is a $466 million project which is soon to commence. It will create 2,839 direct and indirect jobs. The result of it will be that travel from Coorparoo to the city will be reduced from 18 minutes to 10 minutes. By 2016 it will carry 7,000 passengers in the morning peak. As I said, construction is expected to start in the middle of this year, with completion scheduled for 2012. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008312"></A>
On the north side, the Northern Busway from the Royal Children’s Hospital to Windsor is also soon to be completed. This $198 million project is creating 1,529 direct and indirect jobs. It is on schedule to be opened by August this year, one month ahead of schedule. Together with the Northern Busway from Windsor to Kedron, travel between Herston and Kedron will be reduced from 13 minutes to seven minutes in the morning peak and from 19 minutes to seven minutes in the evening peak. By 2016 the busway will cater for 47,000 trips per day, rising to 78,000 trips per day in 2026. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008314"></A>
The Bligh government is also building rail infrastructure. The $800 million stage 1 rail and road transport corridor from Darra to Springfield is currently underway, creating 6,240 direct and indirect jobs. Stage 1 of this project, which I visited just last week, is due for completion in 2011. We are also building a new passenger railway line from Darra to Richlands with a new Richlands station. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1009907"></A>
These are substantial public transport infrastructure projects currently underway across the south-east. Despite the global financial crisis, the Bligh government is on track to meet its strong and green targets as we head Toward Q2. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PJ LAWLOR</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Southport--ALP) (Minister for Tourism and Fair Trading) (10.15 am): In these tough economic times, people sometimes are forced into taking out loans to make ends meet. Unfortunately for these people there are businesses that prey on this need. The Bligh government is not willing to sit back and let dodgy payday lenders rip off vulnerable Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008321"></A>
My department’s Fair Trading inspectors have recovered more than $978,000 for payday lender customers as part of a recent crackdown. Payday lenders from Beenleigh to Cairns have agreed to pay back $978,861 to more than 1,680 cash strapped customers. The industry blitz by Fair Trading was designed to enforce Queensland’s tough new laws targeting excessive interest rates and charges. Inspectors have conducted spot checks on 178 credit providers since 1 July 2008. They have now negotiated the recovery of some $978,000 in excess interest and fees at an average of over $580 per customer, with further reimbursements likely. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008324"></A>
The lenders concerned have also agreed to pay $55,000 to the Consumer Credit Fund, which is used to support the enforcement and promotion of state credit laws. Inspectors have issued 14 warnings and executed 57 conduct deeds with 63 companies in relation to various alleged breaches, from incorrect charging to contractual disclosure issues. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008325"></A>
The Bligh government is determined to protect disadvantaged Queenslanders facing even greater challenges as a result of the global financial crisis. Fair Trading inspectors will continue to monitor the industry closely and will not hesitate to prosecute rogue traders who persist in ripping off their customers. The new laws capping interest rates and other loan charges have now been in force for more than nine months, so there is no excuse for further infringements. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008326"></A>
The blitz identified numerous breaches including excessive interest rates, failure to disclose brokerage fees, failure to disclose to whom commissions were payable, failure to state total payments, failure to adequately inform consumers of their legal rights and failure to make the required disclosures in statements of account. The Bligh government will not step away from its commitment to protect Queenslanders no matter how tough times get.<Hansard-Speech-End>

Hon. PG REEVES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mansfield--ALP) (Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Sport) (10.17 am): Last week I had the pleasure of inspecting, with the member for Townsville, the progress of the inaugural Dunlop Townsville 400 V8 Supercars race, which will run from 10 to 12 July. I am pleased to say that Townsville is ready for what is arguably North Queensland’s biggest ever sporting event.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008330"></A>
The track is complete, ticket sales are soaring and accommodation is at near capacity. More than 88,000 tickets have already been sold for the race, with an estimated 120,000 people expected to attend over the three days. A key component of the Q150 Festival of Sport, without doubt the Dunlop Townsville 400 V8 Supercars race is a win for sports fans, great for jobs and great for the North Queensland economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1008331"></A>
Major construction of the racetrack has just finished. More than 8,000 tonnes of special-purpose asphalt has been laid and more than 1,300 barriers have been fabricated. One of the track’s feature elements, the Ross Creek Bridge, is also complete. At 49 metres long and 12 metres wide, the bridge took more than 865 cubic metres of concrete to build and has 69 precast beams and 14 concrete slabs. The pit building is nearing completion. Workers are still on-site putting the finishing touches to the multipurpose venue building and landscaping. Make no mistake, Townsville is buzzing with excitement in anticipation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010017"></A>
I have to commend everyone involved for the amazing progress they have made at the Reid Park race precinct since my last visit. The Bligh government has invested more than $14 million in the Dunlop Townsville 400 V8 Supercar race and I believe that it is money well spent. The construction of the track and precinct has provided a major economic boost to North Queensland. About 80 percent of the construction work has been delivered by contractors and suppliers, owned or based in North Queensland. During construction, the project will support an estimated 130 jobs. It is also estimated up to 180 jobs will be created as a result of staging the three-day event each year. Preliminary estimates are that the Dunlop Townsville 400 V8 Supercar event will generate $10 million a year in economic benefits for the North Queensland region. The Townsville V8 Supercar event will be a win for sports fans, great for jobs and great for the North Queensland economy.</Hansard-Body>

Social Housing</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. KL STRUTHERS</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Algester--ALP) (Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women) (10.20 am): Gone are the days when social housing was a blot on the landscape. Today, they are contemporary, modern and, more often than not, they are the best-looking house or unit block in the street. This is the way of the future for social housing in Queensland. We are sprucing them up. On top of our own significant investment, we are spending $80 million of the Rudd government’s nation-building stimulus plan to upgrade and repair social housing dwellings. It is a win for social housing and a win for local workers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010029"></A>
I have asked my department to work with the Department of Public Works to fast-track this work. That is why we are rolling out $40 million next year and the year after to bring about even more improvements to social housing. We are sprucing up our social housing stock and we are providing jobs for electricians, plumbers, landscapers, builders, roofers--you name it. We are giving them jobs and job security and the federal funds could not have come at a better time. It is about kick-starting local economies. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010030"></A>
It is a win for the environment, too. We are looking at roofing insulation, rainwater tanks, gas hot-water systems and a solar trial at selected sites. In a few short months we have done roofing upgrades in Wulguru in Townsville. We have built driveways, upgraded roofs and put in new floor coverings in South Mackay. We have spent $50,000 on Thursday Island and we have done maintenance work out west in Cunnamulla, Charleville and Blackwater. So far, we have finished more than 7,000 maintenance and upgrade work orders. All up, we have spent just over $9 million. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011804"></A>
Unlike the opposition, we are about jobs, not job cuts. If its planned three per cent efficiency dividend was applied to the current budget of the department, $22 million would be gone, 70 social housing units would be gone, hundreds of construction jobs would be gone and 275 frontline staff would be gone. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Fraser Island, Dingoes</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011806"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. KJ JONES</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Ashgrove--ALP) (Minister for Climate Change and Sustainability) (10.22 am): April this year marked eight years since the tragic death of Clinton Gage, a young boy who was mauled by a dingo on Fraser Island. Since this tragedy the work being performed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service is integral to protecting the future of the island’s dingo population and, most importantly, improving safety for visitors. Most notably, we have implemented a Fraser Island Dingo Management Strategy that has not only reduced the risk posed to humans but also conserved a sustainable wild dingo population on the island. A key principle of the strategy is that dingoes are regarded as wild, native animals and should be interfered with as little as possible. The strategy has been regularly updated and the public were recently invited to comment on it following the announcement of a scheduled audit by renowned dingo expert, Dr Laurie Corbett. Seventy-five submissions have been forwarded to Dr Corbett for his consideration. Outcomes of the audit are expected in the next couple of months. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010037"></A>
Along with strong enforcement, our dingo education program has become internationally recognised as best practice, although we need to make sure it remains effective in discouraging everyone from feeding dingoes. Therefore, I have asked the department to review the long-term effectiveness of public education about dingoes on the island and feeding penalties. In addition, dingo-deterrent fencing around the main ranger campgrounds, Kingfisher Bay Resort and other townships has proven very effective. There have been no aggressive incidents within these areas. Also, as part of the strategy, scientific research and monitoring have examined dingo behaviour, dietary habits and population size with results indicating the population is viable and in good health. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010038"></A>
Opposition proposals to artificially feed dingoes have been consistently rejected over many years as counterproductive and irresponsible in terms of both the future viability of the dingo population and public safety. Through feeding stations, dingoes lose their natural hunting instincts, begin to associate people with food, and ultimately endanger the safety of everyone on the island. For the strategy to be truly effective, it is reliant upon all people--visitors and locals--to remain vigilant by obeying the laws and guidelines on how to be dingo safe while on Fraser Island. I look forward to the findings of the current strategy audit, but I will not allow a known dangerous dingo to go unchecked and be given another opportunity to attack a child. <Hansard-Speech-End>

<Hansard-Member-Electorate>
Hon. CR DICK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Greenslopes--ALP) (Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations) (10.25 am): I rise to mark the passing of a Queensland hero, Mrs Shirley Joan White, who died of leukaemia on 6 June aged 73. Shirley White was the founder and president of the Queensland Asbestos Related Disease Support Society. For almost 20 years, from 1989, Shirley led this important non-profit organisation and became the face of asbestos advocacy in Queensland. She will be always remembered for her incredible support for workers in our state. Her tireless commitment to the society saw it flourish to more than 1,000 members, with branches throughout Queensland. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010044"></A>
Shirley was heavily involved in the NSW commission of inquiry into James Hardie, which was conducted by Mr David Jackson QC. She was also a catalyst in ensuring that Queensland now has arguably the best statutory lump-sum benefits in the country for sufferers of asbestos related diseases. She was dedicated in her push for legislative reform and played a key role in negotiating new entitlements for dependent family members of sufferers of asbestos diseases. In November 2008, the Queensland Workers’ Compensation and Rehabilitation Act was amended allowing dependants to be entitled to payments of up to $478,000, plus a lump sum for dependants of $63,940, and funeral benefits of $8,525. This is one of Shirley’s great legacies.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010045"></A>
Another of her great achievements was the establishment of Milton Clarke House, a respite facility where regional patients and their families stay when travelling to Brisbane for treatment. Shirley was well known for her work, including her involvement in a range of charities, particularly in the Norman Park and Murarrie areas. In recognition of her advocacy work, Shirley was awarded a medal of the Order of Australia in 2003. She was also awarded the Civil Justice Award, the Rotary International Community Service Award, the Australian Medical Association Award of Distinction and the Griffith Australia Day Award.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010046"></A>
Above all, Shirley was well loved and respected, as was demonstrated at a memorial service that was held for her at Hemmant in Brisbane’s east last week, attended by people from around Australia. Our deepest sympathies go out to Shirley’s family and loved ones. Her loss is mourned by Queenslanders throughout our state, including many members in this place such as the member for Bulimba, the member for Waterford and the member for Rockhampton. Workers throughout Queensland have lost a great advocate, fighter and friend, but her life’s work will live on. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1010047"></A>
In that regard, this morning I have been advised by my cabinet colleague the Minister for Community Services and Housing and Minister for Women that, after vigorous lobbying by Shirley, the Department of Communities will provide one-off funding of $40,000 to the society for a part-time coordinator. I thank the minister and her department for their contribution. It is a fitting tribute to Shirley and her tenacity on behalf of the society and those ill and injured workers whom it represents. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr Speaker, what you see from this government is what you see from all well-developed major economies responding to the economic crisis--a government acting to stimulate the economy, acting to protect jobs, acting to create jobs, acting to keep the motor running in the economy while the private sector collapses around us. Those opposite decided that the role of government was to walk away; we said it was to intervene. The people of Queensland have made a choice and those opposite will see our economic strategy outlined this afternoon.</Hansard-Body>

 Order! Before I call the Leader of the Opposition, some of the language used in interjections is coming close to unparliamentary. I do not want to do the member for Buderim a disservice. I thought I heard an unparliamentary expression before but I was not sure. I will not tolerate it in this House and you know that. </Hansard-Body>

Mr LANGBROEK:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My second question without notice is to the Treasurer. If the Premier will not listen to Sir Leo Hielscher’s warning, why won’t the Treasurer listen to Sir Leo Hielscher’s warning that due to the loss of the AAA credit rating Queenslanders are paying an extra $1.2 billion in interest payments each year--enough to pay for a new Children’s Hospital once a year every year instead of once in a lifetime? </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and for the opportunity to answer that question because the premise on which he bases it is quite misguided. The reality is that the comments that were provided by the chair of QDC were based on a theoretical calculation. The reality is that the difference in borrowing costs between our state and the state of New South Wales and other AAA rated entities in the nation right now is 0.1 of a per cent, not two per cent. So let us not have a debate here about the theoretical notion that what the Leader of the Opposition puts forward is in fact--</Hansard-Body>

Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 No. Let me say this about the Queensland Treasury Corporation, let me say this about Sir Leo Hielscher and let me say this about the officers of the Queensland Treasury, who have on so many occasions been maligned by those members opposite: I consider them to exhibit the utmost professionalism and I have found that officers of the Queensland Treasury are par excellence in the Queensland Public Service in terms of their independence, in terms of the fearlessness of their advice and I greatly respect their counsel, their view and their advice. When the circumstances change, all of a sudden the Liberal National Party want to hide behind the Queensland Treasury when just before the election those opposite were not even prepared to submit their policies to the Queensland Treasury because they knew that that would expose the fragility of their thinking and the absolute lack of clarity on what they were proposing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011917"></A>
Let me be really clear: putting a pathway back to surplus is a priority for the government. Making sure that we look toward the long-term sustainability of the balance sheet is a priority. Let us go to this point: all of a sudden the care and concern that comes from the bankrupted Liberals over on the other side of the parliament about what we need to do to get our credit rating--</Hansard-Body>

Mrs KEECH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Premier. Can the Premier explain to the House the importance of maintaining Queensland’s record building program in a time of global recession? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011987"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for her question. The member for Albert represents a fast-growing electorate and understands the importance of investing in infrastructure now and for the future. In times of global recession, governments all around the world are doing what they can to stimulate their economies. What has emerged recently is evidence that Queensland is holding its own in these very difficult circumstances. This will be the 13th consecutive year that we have grown stronger than the national average. There is certainly much weaker growth than we have seen in recent years, but we are still keeping our head above water and performing better than the national average. And, yes, unemployment, as I have said for a number of months, is getting worse and is likely to get worse before it gets better, as it is around the world, but we are still doing half a per cent better than the national average. That is a lot of people being protected by what is happening in our economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011988"></A>
What is happening to keep that performance above the national average? Our policy settings are what is keeping the motor running in the Queensland economy. It is the policy settings of this government and our determination to maintain our record building program that are creating economic activity, creating investment in communities right across Queensland, in all the regions of our state, and, most importantly, maintaining and creating jobs. At the end of all of this we will have the infrastructure that those communities need. During the next three to four years, as this infrastructure program rolls out, it will be the infrastructure program of Queensland that is stimulating the economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011989"></A>
We have had all of these questions from those opposite this morning aimed directly at cutting the infrastructure program. If you want to satisfy Standard &amp; Poor’s instead of looking after the people of Queensland, the quickest way to do it is to halve the building program. Do what they did last time they had a chance on this side of the House: turn the cranes off, lock up the building sites and put in place a capital works freeze. That would satisfy the ratings agencies, but it would be an economic disaster for people right across Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011991"></A>
I should give credit where it is due. There is at least one member on the other side of the House who believes in infrastructure, and that is the member for Gaven, who told radio this morning that he hopes there will be money in today’s budget to stem unemployment in his electorate in projects that can be brought on quickly such as roads and the new stadium. I congratulate the member for Gaven on his foresight and on his endorsement of our government’s economic strategy. That stadium, which the LNP used money to advertise against, will create jobs on the Gold Coast while it is being built and long after it is in place. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1011999"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question, because it gives me another opportunity to outline for the benefit of the member concerned and the party on the other side of the House what is happening in the global economy. What we have seen around the world is a complete collapse in credit markets. That has snowballed into a collapse in private sector investment in industries such as the construction industry and steel manufacturing. That has a major knock-on effect on the Queensland economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012000"></A>
The Queensland economy is linked to the world. It is a revelation to those opposite, but those of us on this side of the House who work with local industries know that we have seen a collapse in the mining sector, a collapse in the construction sector, a collapse in the property sector and a collapse in consumer confidence, affecting the GST. The basic tenet of the question that has just been asked is the view held by those on the other side of the House that we are living in the same world in 2009 as we were in June 2008. The world has experienced a seismic economic cataclysm. It is affecting economies across the world, and we will not be deniers of the global financial crisis. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012001"></A>
What do we see here this morning? On the one hand, the Leader of the Opposition says that we should be focused on one thing and one thing only, and that is getting the AAA credit rating back regardless of the cost. Then we have the shadow Treasurer--the would-be Leader of the Opposition, the contender--saying, ‘No, you should not be cutting back on expenditure.’ How should we satisfy the Leader of the Opposition and the would-be Leader of the Opposition? They are at complete odds with each other, and therein lies the rub. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012003"></A>
We have to take responsible and difficult decisions, and that is what we are doing. Responsible and difficult decisions are required in the toughest of economic times. You have your head in the sand. You are completely beached on economic policy. On Thursday you will have the chance to tell the people of Queensland how you would do what you propose should be done without your support. They will not back any of the tough decisions and they will not say what they would do. There is no alternative. You are not fit for opposition. </Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Premier. Can the Premier explain the importance of maintaining Queensland’s skills and training effort in a time of global recession? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012008"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. How different the world is from this time last year. This time last year many members will have experienced, as I did, constant concern from the business and industry communities about a lack of skills in the industries that they were working in. We were facing around Australia a skills crisis, whether it was high-skilled doctors or high-skilled engineers. Employers in many sectors of the economy were facing real difficulties getting people even at low-skilled levels. Now those same employers are desperately trying to hang on to the people they have as unemployment rises. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012009"></A>
It would be very short-sighted in focusing on unemployment not to keep a firm eye on the skills agenda and our skills effort. Our population continues to grow strongly. The world global recession will ease, and we have to have confidence and optimism about that. When it does, the need for skilled workers will be as strong as it ever was. We are determined to ensure that Queensland emerges stronger and not weaker, and that means investing in skills.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012010"></A>
That is why in the recent election campaign we committed to a 125 per cent payroll tax rebate for people who employ apprentices and trainees. We have agreed to a 10 per cent requirement for apprentices and trainees on our capital works projects across-the-board, and our biggest ever effort on skills training--150,000 places over four years. That is a solid investment. Queensland is now training 24 per cent of all apprentices trained in Australia. We have just on 20 per cent of the population share, and yet here in this state we are training almost a quarter of all of the apprentices in Australia. We are punching well and truly above our weight on skills, and that is what we will continue to do.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1012012"></A>
I thought it would be interesting to look at how the skills development project on the other side of the House is going. How is the mentor going in developing the skills of the Leader of the Opposition? If you go to the Google news site, which covers broadcast and print websites, it reports that in the 30 days to last Thursday the Leader of the Opposition had 124 media stories. How many had his mentor had? He had 138. So we have the mentor knocking the contender out of the race, not stopping for the training on the way. We have the supervisor knocking the apprentice right out of the ring, not bothering to share the skills, taking every opportunity for himself. Whether he is on learner wheels or not, it is his and he will take it. I think we all know what is going on over there. </Hansard-Body>

 My question without notice is to the Treasurer. I refer to reported concerns of the Public Sector Union that this government is planning a purge of temporary public servants. Will the Treasurer give a commitment that none of these 34,000 people will lose their jobs or have their positions abolished? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014397"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who considers his role as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition as a temporary position and one with a guarantee for employment that he is not going to provide for the member for Surfers Paradise. That is a very short-term contract. That is merely the sort of employment that one has for two or three months longer as a blocking strategy, because the real recruitment strategy was to stop the member for Clayfield from getting to the front, to make sure we preserve the opportunity for the returning Deputy Leader of the Opposition to do away with the total artifice that has been the reign of the member for Surfers Paradise in the leader’s chair. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014398"></A>
To go directly to the returning Leader of the Opposition’s question, the reality is this. Temporary jobs in the public sector have existed every year. Some of those will start and some of those will end. That is the nature of those jobs being temporary. They are contract jobs and they come to an end at times because the project might end. The reality is that those positions, which are temporary or contracted from time to time, come and go. No-one should be under any illusions that that has not always been the case and will not be the case into the future. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014399"></A>
Not only is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition out there taking all the oxygen away from the interim Leader of the Opposition; he is doing it in such a way that he is really out there asking everybody to realise how right he was. He is asking everyone to say sorry. He is saying, ‘Why didn’t the people of Queensland vote for me?’ We saw him put out a pathetic media release on the Friday before last asking everyone for an apology. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1016868"></A>
The people of Queensland do not need to apologise for anything. They got it right on 21 March--as they got it right in 2006, as they got it right in 2004 and as they will get it right in 2012, when it comes around to No. 4. The reality is that three times the people of Queensland have got it right. Pretty soon this charade is going to end and the game will be back on. When that time comes, this side of the House will stand square shouldered for the future to support the economy, to support jobs, to keep a building program going. When we get to that point in time in 2012, with you again, we will back ourselves in because we like nothing more than putting the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on display, because every time it is a winner for this government. </Hansard-Body>

My question without notice is to the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. Can the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health inform the House about strategies Queensland Health has put in place to improve access to health care for rural and remote Queenslanders? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014407"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. She has a keen interest in rural and remote health. I know that it is an issue of concern that members on both sides of the House share. One of the things that I think is absolutely great about Queensland is that it is a decentralised state. The opportunity to improve and do better what we can for people in rural and remote areas is very important.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014409"></A>
As part of a Queensland Health restructure, late last year we established the Office of Rural and Remote Health. That office comprises units in Roma, Toowoomba, Cairns and Brisbane and brings together various groups primarily concerned with rural and remote health issues under the one structure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014410"></A>
Rural generalist medicine was recognised as a unique pathway in May 2008. We need to acutely understand the particular challenges that present themselves for rural doctors and rural practitioners. A new category of doctor, the rural generalist is someone who has a rural and remote medical discipline developed to provide the medical services that are needed. In many respects they have to be very highly skilled because they are delivering what they do without the benefits of what those in many other parts of Queensland have--that is, larger hospitals to support them. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014411"></A>
Rural and remote Queensland will benefit from advanced skills in obstetrics, anaesthetics, Indigenous health, surgery and emergency medicine. We have 19 scholarship holders and rural generalist trainees appointed to rural hospitals in 2009. At least 33 rural generalist trainees commenced internship and prevocational training in 2009, up from 22 in 2008. We have a total of 114 trainees currently taking the rural generalist pathway. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014412"></A>
In its 65th year, our rural scholarship scheme continues to assist in the sustainability of rural services and facilities through the supply of rural health professionals across medicine, nursing and allied health. There are health professionals in the nursing and the allied health areas and nurse practitioners and remote nurses who work in rural and remote communities. It is important to understand that there are areas to which it is not possible to attract doctors. We can have our very highly skilled nurses and allied professionals delivering those services in those communities. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014413"></A>
One of the things I am very keen to work on in my time as health minister is the issue of telehealth. Modern technology provides tremendous opportunities for us to visit and see people in a remote location. I was at Toowoomba General Hospital a little while ago and saw a mother and her child from the Western Downs undertake their preoperation appointments through telehealth. Telehealth is a wonderful opportunity, particularly bearing in mind the Rudd government’s additional investment in broadband, to actually make sure we can deliver supervision, training, support and mentoring in remote services as much as we can in this great state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014414"></A>
Rural and remote health is something of interest to us whether we represent a coastal urban electorate like mine or a remote far western or far northern electorate. It actually matters. People in these communities are getting better services as a result of these initiatives. </Hansard-Body>

What the government is doing at the moment is this. We have provided 500 more clinical staff for the Sunshine Coast since 2005. There is the redevelopment of the Nambour Hospital. There will be 30 extra beds in Caloundra and another 96 to be built. </Hansard-Body>

One thing I never sunk to in my times of fighting with Howard for more road funding was to accuse him of that. That speaks volumes about your attitude to public office.

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014507"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr FRASER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for Burleigh for her question. The reality is that as we move towards 1 July--the commencement date for the Green Army initiative, the $57 million initiative that this government took to the last election campaign to provide work for 3,000 Queenslanders--already there are 160 organisations that are registered. From Cape York in the north to Dalby in the west and, yes, to Burleigh Heads in the south, organisations are lining up to be a part of the Green Army initiative, because that initiative will provide direct work. It will provide training. It will provide a vocation for young people and unemployed people who are being left behind by the effects of the downturn in the economy. That work is being directed at projects of value, at projects of worth, at projects that go to improving the environment that exists in this state, and there are many worthy projects in the line-up as we move to the 1 July implementation date for the Green Army. It is a commitment that this government took to the last election and it is a commitment that this government will honour as we deliver a Green Army that goes to improving the environment at many locations right around the state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014513"></A>
Creating jobs for those people who are not otherwise gainfully employed is something that really could be a principle applied to the Liberal and National Party at the moment, because we know that there is no work going on over on the other side because the interim Leader of the Opposition, holding the view that he does that he has no requirement to put forward any policy, has gone to the hammock and is not proposing any policies to put forward to the people of Queensland. Yet this morning he walks in and asks for us to take action on a credit rating while single-handedly also holding a proposition that he is not going to support the Renewing Queensland Plan. He wants us to take action but he is going to vote against the action that we are proposing. Hypocrisy is being visited upon this parliament by the very fact that the interim Leader of the Opposition could dare to put forward that proposition while holding the disgraceful position that he does in opposing the plan that the government is putting forward.</Hansard-Body>

The reality is that the interim Leader of the Opposition is like Dicky Knee without the backbone, and he is still taking advice from the global financial crisis denier--the ostrich. Playing the role of Ozzie Ostrich is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition--head firmly in the ground saying, ‘There’s no problem. There’s nothing to see here. Nothing’s going on in the global economy’--ostrich head straight in the ground. But what we know is that the head is rising. Here comes Ozzie Ostrich again and hey, hey it is going to be a great old time when the deputy leader returns back to the forefront of the leadership, and this government cannot wait.</Hansard-Body>

Mr BLEIJIE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health. Given that the minister restated just 21 days ago that his government was committed to building the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, what has changed in the past 21 days?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014532"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr LUCAS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for his question. I indicated before that the government is committed to building the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, but we want to make sure that we can deliver on that. The opportunity to purchase private sector beds gives the opportunity to promote the business case for a private sector proponent to build a hospital and at the same time allows the state government the opportunity to ensure that we can provide beds sooner. That is what that does. Any university hospital--any great hospital--will only work appropriately with a private hospital with it, and this is an important part of it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014533"></A>
The honourable member should be aware of the fact that there are difficult financing times in the private sector for PPPs, and this is something that the government is keen to address. That is why, for example, it gives us the opportunity to say that with a 250-bed private hospital we will purchase up to--off the top of my head--110 beds over the course of a number years. That then helps those people who are seeking to bank those projects and construct them actually make sure that they are delivered, and that is a good thing for the Sunshine Coast. The honourable member would be aware that the Noosa Hospital has a model whereby we purchase beds in the Noosa Hospital. Ultimately, that hospital will come over to public ownership in due course.</Hansard-Body>

 The additional beds will not only meet the bed capacity earlier but also help us reverse--not totally--patient flows that are going to Brisbane at the moment. Clearly, it is desirable to have the minimum number of patient flows from the Sunshine Coast to Brisbane. But let us make it clear: from any part of Queensland, other than Brisbane itself, there will be patient flows ultimately. For example, the most serious burns go to the burns unit at RBWH. The most serious transplant cases generally go to one of the hospitals in Brisbane, and those things will happen as well under this. This is about delivering something that is sustainable. Indeed, it is about delivering beds in the private sector sooner. We will do it, unlike--</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014552"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr WILSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for the question. Those on this side of the House have become quite familiar in the last six to nine months, as has the rest of Australia, with the impact on the Queensland and the Australian economy of the global financial crisis--morphing into the great recession where the bulk, if not all, of the G20 countries are all in recession at the same time. Unlike the opposition, which does not seem to appreciate the reality of this economic crisis, we know--however, the opposition does not--that there are between 5,000, 6,000 or possibly 7,000 directly employed miners who have lost their jobs since November last year. The multiplier effect with miners is about one to four, so you are looking at quite a big impact upon those industries that support the mining industry.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014555"></A>
Let us look at construction. Approvals for home construction fell from 32,000 down to 20,000 in one year. That is why the Rudd government introduced its Building the Education Revolution to put a stimulation package into the construction industry in Queensland, and this government is working closely with the federal government to deliver that project. We are providing projects to 1,251 state schools and about 400-odd non-state schools. The funds allocated to the schools are being spent on projects at those schools. They are being spent and expended by the private sector--by contractors--not by the government. The prices that are being fixed for those projects have been determined on a competitive market basis. They are public funds that are being made available to ensure that we create jobs, jobs and jobs in the construction industry. The fact that the figure of 32,000 building approvals has gone down to 20,000 building approvals in the last 12 months in the cottage industry is reflective of what is happening in the construction industry generally. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1014557"></A>
The funding is fixed for those schools. There is no supplementation, so they have to manage those public funds carefully. Contract packages are put together to ensure that we get value for money. As well, the funds are being spread across Queensland so that the funds create as many jobs as possible. Holland Park State School applied to have an extension to a hall and it was granted it. It also applied for a new resource centre and was granted it. That school will get both and if there are any surplus funds those funds will be spent on projects on which the P&amp;C, the school and the Australian government will negotiate. Why? Because the funding in this program is allocated to children for the purposes of--</Hansard-Body>

Mr WALLACE:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I made a bit of a mistake in the parliament at the last sittings. I said we created only 25,000 jobs in our roads program; it was 28,000 jobs this year--28,000 jobs across this state in roads, not 25,000 as I originally stated. What a great figure. It shows that we are keeping Queenslanders working and, at the same time, building better roads. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017088"></A>
 But in order to continue to do that across this state, we have to make some tough decisions in this tough economic climate. This government has the courage to do that--to keep those 28,000 Queenslanders working, to keep those 28,000 Queenslanders putting bread and butter on the table for their families. I was disappointed at the last sittings to hear the opposition decry those 28,000 jobs and to decry better roads for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

Sex Offenders, Monitoring</Hansard-Level-2-Heading>

Mr PITT:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question is to the Minister for Police, Corrective Services and Emergency Services. Can the minister advise the House on how his department monitors sex offenders in the community? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017098"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr ROBERTS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for the question. The management of dangerous sexual offenders in the community is one of the most problematic and difficult issues that is confronted by government and, indeed, the community. I think it is fair to say, though, that in 2003 the Queensland Labor government enacted the toughest legislation in the country to control dangerous sexual offenders. That legislation provided that, at the end of a person’s sentence, the courts, on application by the Attorney-General, can continue to detain a dangerous sexual offender or, if the court determined it appropriate, release such a person into the community under strict conditions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017099"></A>
It has been the Labor government’s policy to argue in all cases that these people should be detained in custody. However, we are subject to the decisions of the courts and in a number of instances the courts have released some of these offenders into the community on very strict conditions. In an endeavour to increase the monitoring that we can put in place through Corrective Services, the legislation was amended in the past couple of years to enable electronic monitoring to be a mandatory condition for a number of these offenders. Currently, 21 people in the community are subject to electronic monitoring. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017100"></A>
There has been some media coverage over the past day or so in relation to an alleged offence that occurred at South Bank on the weekend. Of course, I, the government and indeed parents and families are obviously very concerned about this particular incident. Thankfully, this particular offender is now back in custody and will appear before the courts and the courts will make the determination as to whether additional conditions need to be placed on this offender or whether they will choose the additional option of returning him to custody. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1017101"></A>
There have been questions raised about the electronic monitoring system and whether, in fact, GPS systems would be better in these circumstances. The government is not opposed to GPS systems. However, the current electronic monitoring that we have in place is an effective means of monitoring the curfews that are imposed on these people. We need to continually monitor this technology, because it is not foolproof, as is the electronic monitoring not foolproof. As well, GPS systems still require constant supervision of the offenders. GPS has technical difficulties, such as black spots. In many instances it requires the offenders to change batteries on a regular basis and, even in the jurisdictions where GPS is used, there are instances where they have not been able to track the offenders 24 hours a day, seven days a week. However, we will continue to evaluate that technology. </Hansard-Body>

 It is a habit I am happy to practise on the member, but certainly not when I rang Mr Simon Smith, the person to whom the member alludes, who threatened me with going to the Liberal Party. I told him to go ahead and do it. If that is abuse, I plead guilty. The reality is that Mr Simon Smith contacted my office. I telephoned him once in the morning when I was on my way to Mount Isa and I telephoned him again when I got to Mount Isa. I asked him to provide me with the evidence of the statements that he was making. He demanded that I sack a QBuild employee and that a QBuild employee would be sacked as a result. I advised him that this side of politics has procedural fairness and that we have an industrial relations system in this state.

 I certainly did not abuse the parent and I actually pointed out to the parent how seriously I treat asbestos as my father died with the disease. I treat the issue very seriously. Unlike the member opposite, who has never got her hands dirty in her life, I have actually nailed asbestos above my head. I know exactly what the risks are and I treat it very seriously. I told Mr Smith this, but his attitude was that he would go to the Liberal Party and deal with the matter there. I still have not seen any evidence. But what have we done? We have ensured that a full and proper inquiry is taking place by the Department of Workplace Health and Safety. </Hansard-Body>

 My question is to the Minister for Community Services, Housing and Minister for Women. About a dozen homeless people have set up a makeshift camp in the Redcliffe showgrounds informally known as Camp Lamington. I understand that Housing staff visited the site last week. Can the minister please inform the House what steps the department is taking to address the homelessness issue in Redcliffe?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019476"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms STRUTHERS:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the member for her question. She knows that a number of people are doing it tough. We understand what they are going through and we are doing everything we can to put a roof over their heads. Housing officers visited the site at Redcliffe on Friday. They interviewed around 12 people staying in the showgrounds and offered them assistance in lodging applications for housing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019477"></A>
We have embarked on a whole-of-government response. A meeting was held in Redcliffe yesterday with representatives from Child Safety, Housing, Disability Services, Communities and police to work through the issues. Mark my words, we will do whatever we can to help people through these troubled times. Everyone needs someone to turn to and somewhere safe when times are rough. We will not turn our back on people who need a helping hand to get their lives back on track. That is why we are spending $235 million over four years on our Responding to Homelessness initiative. That is why we fund more than 230 services, crisis accommodation, women’s refuges and places for young people and families with nowhere to go. That is why we are building--how many, members?--4,000 new social housing units around the state. That is why we convened an urgent conference in Redcliffe yesterday. We have got our sleeves rolled up and we are working in partnership with the non-government sector right now to link these people to services they need to help turn their lives around. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1021780"></A>
We are also actively on the lookout for temporary accommodation for them while their longer term needs are being addressed. We do not turn our back on the battlers. We need bipartisan support; we need community support for our social housing programs. We need community acceptance of people who need social housing. </Hansard-Body>

Mrs CUNNINGHAM:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 My question without notice is to the Premier. How can workers at Gladstone Ports Corporation and QR have any confidence in this government or their job security after being told by the Premier during the election that there would be no privatisation of GOCs?</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019483"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Ms BLIGH:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 As I have outlined previously in this House and, in fact, when I was questioned about this issue during the election campaign, I repeatedly said that that was a matter that could not be ruled out given the financial circumstances. My answer was accurately reported in a number of media outlets. What I can say to the member for Gladstone is that the industrial working groups that are designed to help ensure that the entitlements and job security of workers involved in these entities are protected have been put in place and the first meeting of those industrial working groups occurred last Friday. The Minister for Industrial Relations will be overseeing that process between now and the completion of these sales. I understand that at least at this early stage those groups will be meeting on a weekly basis to ensure that unions representing workers in all of these entities will have plenty of opportunities to raise concerns, to ask questions and to be part of the continued decision making around the scoping exercise in relation to the Queensland Rail asset. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019484"></A>
I understand that the member for Gladstone, like other members in this House, represents an electorate where this will have a bigger impact than in other places. The vision that we have for these entities is that post the sale what they will have is a private sector investor putting money into them, expanding them, growing them as businesses and operating commercially and what we will see is, in fact, more jobs and better job security as a result. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019485"></A>
I have every confidence that these organisations, as a result of not having to compete in every budget round for new coal wagons or new schools, new railway lines for the coal sector or new hospitals--if they do not have to compete, if they are part of a company that only does that sort of business--will invest without that level of burden and without that competition. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019486"></A>
As I said, our government has a very strong vision in relation to these sales. We understand that many people will have concerns and questions. We are working with their unions to ensure that they are kept informed, but we are also very concerned to ensure that they have a long-term secure future, that they are not run down in government ownership because they are unable to secure the investment they need but grow under private investment through these asset sales as we have seen in many other asset sales of these sorts of businesses in the past, both here in Queensland and nationally. That is the vision that we will be working to secure and I am very, very confident that what we will see is bigger, better, growing businesses employing more people and doing more business, raising more profit and generating more prosperity in areas like Gladstone. </Hansard-Body>

Ms JONES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I thank the honourable member for his question. Despite the global financial crisis, which has hit all economies in the world including ours here in Queensland, we are getting on with the job of delivering services and new initiatives. One of those initiatives is the greater protection of Moreton Bay. I know that the member has a keen interest in ensuring that we keep Moreton Bay sustainable for future generations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019492"></A>
As all members in this House would be aware, we have introduced green zones. Up until now we have actually had an amnesty with regard to delivering fines as a consequence of breaching these green zones. I am very pleased to inform the House that during this four-month amnesty we have had rangers out on the water talking to our fishermen. Only 70 people have breached the green zones and up until now we have been giving them warnings. From 1 July, however, fines will now come into place. People will face a $500 on-the-spot fine if they are found to be breaching these laws. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1019493"></A>
I think that everyone understands that this government is absolutely committed to sustainability in Moreton Bay, and that is why we introduced these green zones. I know that these green zones are an issue of contention within the LNP and I note Paul Williams’s article in today’s paper where the deputy leader of the LNP claims that he is still very bitter about the outcomes of the election and is looking for the undisciplined member of the LNP who has been talking about green zones and increased fishing in this area and winding them back. I guess the question on all our lips this morning is: who is this undisciplined member of the LNP who came out making comments about winding back the green zones and promoting uranium mining? I actually thought it might be the usual suspects: the member for Maroochydore or perhaps my neighbour, the member for Moggill, who was accused of being terribly undisciplined in the last election--I am with you, Bruce. But guess who it was? It was none other than the member for Southern Downs himself. </Hansard-Body>

Ms JONES:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 That is right. He is sitting there apparently feeling bitter and twisted about the election result as a consequence of these undisciplined LNP members and the very person who showed that undisciplined behaviour was the member himself. It was he who went on ABC Radio in Mount Isa and claimed that the LNP will not put any impediments in place with regard to introducing uranium mining here in Queensland. It was the member for Southern Downs who went and spoke to the members down by the bay and said, ‘We will not protect sustainable fishing practices in Moreton Bay; no, what we want to do is wind back the sensible policy that has been put in place.’ What we are seeing here this morning is that members of the LNP are still as divided and undisciplined as they were before the election. They stand here question after question asking for increases in services yet provide no answer as to how they would fund them.

Mr LANGBROEK</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Surfers Paradise--LNP) (Leader of the Opposition) (11.30 am): This afternoon at 2.30 the final moment of reckoning will be here. We will hear the confession of the honourable member for South Brisbane and the honourable member for Mount Coot-tha, who will admit and reveal everything that Labor hid from Queenslanders just three months ago. This morning in her first ministerial statement the Premier spoke about our population growth being greater than that of any other state, with 2,000 people moving to Queensland every week over the last year. That has been the crux of the problem for this state for the past 20 years--that is, this government did not plan for population growth. It failed to plan for infrastructure. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028053"></A>
The Premier and the Treasurer love to talk about the global financial crisis, even though they claim that they found out about the details of it only after 22 March. This morning we have already heard the shadow Treasurer say that in June last year the Premier ruled out bringing in a fuel tax in order to support struggling Queensland families. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028055"></A>
Last year Queensland Investment Corporation chief Doug McTaggart said that a global storm--a perfect storm--was bearing down on the Queensland economy. At that time the <Hansard-Italic>
Gold Coast Bulletin</Hansard-Italic>
 quoted the Treasurer as saying that the cyclone bolts were in place, the bungs were in the tinnie and the masking tape was on the windows. He implied that the Queensland government was prepared for what was coming. He gave no hint of what was going to come in terms of the promises Labor made during the election campaign. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028056"></A>
Since the election campaign of 21 March we have heard about growing deficits, falling revenue, a massive sell-off of state assets, a new fuel tax, rising state government charges and cuts to Public Service pay rises. Now, of course, there is a brawl with public sector unions over wages, and yesterday we heard about the announced cuts to subsidies for councils for water and sewerage infrastructure charges in the years to come. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028057"></A>
That is why Queenslanders feel so ripped off as we approach 2.30 this afternoon. It is like a convolution of two movies that I remember from my youth:<Hansard-Italic>
 Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</Hansard-Italic>
 and <Hansard-Italic>
The Sting</Hansard-Italic>
. After 2.30 we will see Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the Premier and the Treasurer, ride off into the sunset having played out the final element of the sting. This will be the final scene that was first set up during the election campaign. The sting is asking the people of Queensland for their vote. That is the big bet that was placed, and the final pay-off will come at 2.30 this afternoon when the ‘Sundance Kid’, the member for Mount Coot-tha, delivers his budget. Having taken for granted the trust and the vote of the people of Queensland, he will ride off into the sunset. Labor thinks it can say whatever it likes in an election campaign and do whatever it likes afterwards and the people of Queensland will not remember. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028058"></A>
Let us look at the responsibility of this Treasurer. He loves to quote from old-time budgets, he loves to use esoteric words to show off his great intellect and he loves to talk about intellectual capacity. Let us look at his record and compare it to those of other Labor treasurers in the Beattie and Bligh governments: David Hamill, Terry Mackenroth, Peter Beattie and Anna Bligh, who was the Treasurer before the current Treasurer. Really, it was when the member for South Brisbane, Anna Bligh, was Treasurer that spending by this government went out of control. The ‘Sundance Kid’, the member for Mount Coot-tha, has not been able to rein in that spending. Last year’s statistics show that revenue for this government went up by one per cent but spending went up by 10 per cent. How on earth can that happen? In fact, over the past four years, from 2006 to the end of the next financial year, spending by this government is budgeted to have gone up by 52 per cent. Which Queensland families are doing that? Which Queensland businesses are doing that? </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028059"></A>
I put it to the House that the ‘Sundance Kid’, the member for Mount Coot-tha, is the weakest and most incompetent Treasurer this state has seen under the Bligh and Beattie governments, yet he loves to come in here and talk about intellectual capacity. He has broken every promise he has made. A month before the election he promised the people of Queensland that there would be no fuel tax; now we know that we are getting a fuel tax that will impact on all Queenslanders. After 1 July, every time you fill your car, every time you buy food at the supermarket, every time you turn on the tap or flick on the lights, you will pay more because of the ‘Sundance Kid’, the member for Mount Coot-tha. He loves to come in here and talk, but what he has delivered are massive cost increases to the people of Queensland because he could not rein in government spending as he was too daunted by the former Treasurer, the member for South Brisbane. Clearly we have a massive and constant increase in recurrent expenditure that the Treasurer has been unable to rein in. He is the weakest and most incompetent Treasurer that we have seen. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028060"></A>
Costs are out of control, and the time for blaming the global financial crisis and everyone else is over. Anna Bligh and Andrew Fraser chose to lie to the people of Queensland. They are breaking the promises that they made just three weeks ago. They racked up $64 billion of debt before the global financial crisis was even heard of. Yesterday Queensland’s most respected banker as head of the Queensland Treasury Corporation, Sir Leo Hielscher, said that Queensland’s current debt and the interest that has to be paid because of the loss of our AAA credit rating will cost us the equivalent of a new children’s hospital every year, year after year, instead of once in a lifetime. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028061"></A>
Last year the Treasurer refused to take the advice that it was important to protect our AAA credit rating. In fact, he was determined to go ahead with massive infrastructure spending, which we on this side supported. As it turns out, yesterday the government revealed that it is not going to be able to spend all of last year’s infrastructure budget of $17 billion. Even that core Labor promise will not be fulfilled. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028062"></A>
Of course, we all know that on 21 March the Premier and the Treasurer promised Queenslanders that they could count on them. The greatest of all their promises was the creation of 100,000 jobs. What did we see last week? Up to 121,700 Queenslanders are now unemployed. In May last year 83,000 Queenslanders were unemployed. I believe that most Queenslanders watching the television coverage of the lead-up to the 21 March election would have had no idea that 106,000 Queenslanders were unemployed. Clearly that promise has gone by the wayside. The Premier and the Treasurer are now mouthing platitudes about unemployed Queenslanders, but what are they doing? They are increasing the costs on businesses and making it more difficult for people working in the tourism, construction and development industries. Clearly, everything they said was aimed simply at winning the election, which is why Queenslanders now feel that they have been the subject of a big sting. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028063"></A>
Finally, I want to refer to a letter that I wrote to the Treasurer, seeking some advice about today’s budget and the arrangements pertaining to the opposition. The Treasurer says--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028064"></A>
I look forward to next week’s debate on the 2009-10 budget as I anticipate you will be in a position to propose policy propositions rather than merely reflexively and unthoughtfully opposing the budget. As you know, I consider you have this capacity despite the position you adopted last week. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028065"></A>
He is referring to the last parliamentary sitting week. I do not need to hear patronising comments about capacity from the worst and weakest Treasurer in Queensland’s history. As for policy propositions, I oppose poor financial management and stewardship. Here are some more policy propositions: do not say one thing before an election, thinking that you can change it all afterwards because the people of Queensland will not remember; do not mislead the people about the debt situation that you put us in; do not rule out taxes in the month before an election and then introduce one three months later; do not try to kid the people that you found out the true situation the day after an election--the Treasurer is playing us all for fools; do not tell people that they will not be worse off and then increase the price of electricity, water and everything else and then come in here crying tiger tears about it; do not tell people that they can count on you when clearly they cannot; and do not give people trite statements--such as we heard from the honourable the Treasurer the other day--that a low-tax state is a low-service state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028066"></A>
Queensland is the state that I grew up in. It has always been proud of the services it has been able to provide. It has always prided itself on being able to deliver those services through a tax regime and a balanced budget that the coalition brought in in 1989. It has taken 20 years for Labor to ruin the budgetary situation in Queensland, but it has managed to do it now. That is always the way with Labor. Labor members always come in and say that they will not do something but then they do. We have seen it with Kevin Rudd. They are all about deceit and debt. That is what this lot are all about. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028067"></A>
As I say, I do not need lectures from the weakest and most incompetent Treasurer, who should go and get a real job because he has never had a job. All he has ever done is work for other politicians and then he comes in here and thinks that by using big words he impresses us. The people of Queensland are ready and waiting for this lot when we go to the next election. We will not forget. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HOOLIHAN</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Keppel--ALP) (11.40 am): As we move towards the end of the first decade of the 21st century, I think it is timely to remind people that last year the Bligh government produced a program called Toward Q2: Tomorrow’s Queensland. Within that program, under the ‘Healthy Queensland’ area, one of the aims was to halve obesity by 2020. That led to nominations for Healthy Queensland Awards. Nominations were called for last year, and there were quite a number of entrants. I understand from the Keep Australia Beautiful Council CEO, Carole Miller, that there were something like 360 nominations in our area alone. They were short-listed. I remind members that the prize money for the Healthy Queensland Awards is $1 million for Queensland’s healthiest community, $500,000 for Queensland’s healthiest school and $100,000 for Queensland’s healthiest workplace. That money is to go towards health promotion programs in those areas to try to make Queensland a healthy state. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028113"></A>
Last Wednesday the Keep Australia Beautiful Council awarded the Central Queensland semifinalists. There were two semifinalists in both the workplace category and the school category and one semifinalist in the community category. In the workplace category, the Jellinbah Mining Pty Ltd and the Rockhampton Women’s Health Centre were semifinalists. Both of those groups have programs in their workplaces to increase participation in exercise but also to deal with the whole person, particularly Jellinbah Mining. After discussions with the CEO of Keep Australia Beautiful Council, it appears that the program produced by Jellinbah Mining will be looked at for implementation as a national program. That program provides holistic assistance to all people in the workplace--physical, medical treatment and assistance in their everyday lives. Rockhampton Women’s Health Centre implemented a program in the community to promote women’s health specifically. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028120"></A>
There were two semifinalists in the school category. One of the schools was Rockhampton State High School. They have a program that was introduced by one of the teachers, Irene Pass, and ably supported by the principal, John Allison. Hopefully the program from Rockhampton State High School will be interlinked with the Rockhampton Women’s Health Centre to promote health in the larger community. The other school was Boyne Island State School. It also has a program that covers the whole school and that will hopefully produce healthier children. Maybe that is where we should start with some of these programs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028126"></A>
The semifinalist in the community category was the Gladstone Regional Council, represented by Deputy Mayor Gail Sellers. That is a whole-of-community program. It has a website to encourage all groups to get involved and to fit in with the council program. It is very well set up. I encourage everyone to have a look at the Gladstone Regional Council website at www.gladstonerc.qld.gov.au. It is a program that I believe will ultimately assist the whole community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028130"></A>
Those five semifinalists will be in Brisbane to contest the finals, which I understand will be on either 11 or 13 August. I congratulate the Central Queensland semifinalists and wish all of those people involved with the Healthy Queensland Awards a great year. I understand that next year’s awards will be open from September this year. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms O’NEILL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Kallangur--ALP) (11.45 am): This week is International Men’s Health Week, celebrated in Australia since 2003. Men and boys face different health concerns from women and girls, and International Men’s Health Week is an opportunity to both acknowledge these differences and look for ways to improve the health and wellbeing of men and boys. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028137"></A>
The Queensland government has set a goal for all Queenslanders to be Australia’s healthiest people by focusing on prevention. Specifically, Queensland Health administers a range of policies targeting prominent disease associated with men’s health including heart disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes. These diseases are among key areas addressed under the Queensland Strategy for Chronic Disease. This strategy addresses lifestyle risk factors such as unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and tobacco and alcohol abuse. These factors are relevant for all Queenslanders but are particularly relevant to men’s health. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028139"></A>
In the area of mental health, the Queensland government has committed funding to the Queensland Plan for Mental Health to improve the quality of and access to mental health services for Queenslanders. One area of study speaks about social determinants of men’s health and the examination of the circumstances of men’s lives and the resultant impact on health. For example, men who retire have often worked hard to provide for their family and their daily work situation has provided them with contact with other people and a sense of purpose in life. After retirement, a man’s health--physical and mental--can deteriorate as he can lose many human contacts and sometimes lose also a sense of purpose. These are his social determinants of health, and health services should be taking them into consideration and supporting initiatives which support men. Many men find that retirement hits them hard. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028141"></A>
Preretirement dreams of golf and fishing are not often the reality. Instead, men may talk about being left behind and losing contact with work colleagues who were often their only social contact. Modern medical research has confirmed that social support has a powerful protective effect on health. It can potentially add years to your life. Having people to confide in and share social activities boosts the body’s immune system, acts as a buffer against the effects of stress on health and is protective of mental health. Being isolated and cut off from friends and social support is associated with higher levels of depression, coronary heart disease and having two to five times the risk of dying from all causes compared to those with strong social ties. </Hansard-Body>

What is seldom recognised is that meaningful social support may be different for men and women. Men and women may prefer and react better to vastly different communication styles and activities. One community group that has long recognised the need for men to have access to social support is the Australian Men’s Sheds Association. Since 1999, in recognition of the particular needs of older men, there has emerged a growing network of ‘Men’s Sheds’ around Australia. As the Australian Men’s Sheds Association says on its website--</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1028146"></A>
There’s nothing new about men gathering together in their own space to talk, share skills, swap ideas, solve problems or just discuss life in general--it’s been happening since the beginning of time. There’s nothing new either about men spending time in their backyard shed--an acknowledged Aussie pastime. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028147"></A>
What is new is that men, particularly retired men, are combining these two activities in a communal space simply called a “Men’s Shed”. What is also new is how strongly men have embraced this new identity--being a member of a Men’s Shed. Men’s Sheds, as such, are a peculiarly Australian phenomenon. In the past decade a wide range of community-based Men’s Sheds has sprung up--each with its own unique identity and purpose. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The common theme in all Sheds is about men feeling useful and contributing again to their communities, learning or sharing their skills, making friends, networking and availing themselves of health information programmes and opportunities. Men’s Sheds are under the auspices of a variety of organisations whose ethos they tend to exemplify. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Men’s Sheds are fast being recognized as vital, viable places to fulfil these needs and provide relaxed, happy creative spaces for men to enjoy. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028180"></A>
In recognition of the value to the community of Men’s Sheds, in Kallangur a dedicated, resourceful and enthusiastic committee of men are working hard to establish a Men’s Shed in Petrie. They have been meeting in a suburban shed with the generous support of the owner of the property and actively fundraising. They have received much attention from aged-care facilities and community groups who all acknowledge the benefits of having such a facility. They have obtained land in Old Petrie Town and are fundraising through another great Aussie tradition, the sausage sizzle.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028183"></A>
I congratulate the committee for its hard work. It provides an excellent example of what can be achieved when community health is seen as everyone’s responsibility. A successful Men’s Shed and the accompanying services and opportunities provided may play a large role in the prevention strategies promoted by Queensland Health and Toward Q2. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr JOHNSON</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Gregory--LNP) (11.50 am): We heard the Premier say in the parliament again this morning that the government is acting to keep the motors of the Queensland economy running. Let me say that the motors of Queensland Rail are not running. In Western Queensland at the moment we are having services cut on a daily basis because of the failure of Queensland Rail in its community service obligation to provide locomotives to carry freight into those western areas and livestock back out.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1028190"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr JOHNSON:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 I take the interjection from the honourable member for Toowoomba South. It cannot do the basics. The member for Toowoomba South has spoken in this place on numerous occasions about the backlog of B-doubles and semitrailers running through the streets of Toowoomba. Swift Australia, which is a meat processing operation at Dinmore, kills in the vicinity of 800,000 cattle a year, and 200,000 of those cattle come via rail. If they do not come via rail, while it might only be 20 per cent of the operation, all the rest of those cattle will come via B-doubles through the streets of Toowoomba, down the Warrego Highway and will impact on the already overtaxed, deteriorating road system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028195"></A>
Last week Teys Brothers had to make alternative arrangements after a train was cancelled at Julia Creek. Producers had to find ways of getting cattle there a week later and then on to Lakes Creek, where they were finally killed. This is not good enough. These companies employ people, too. An operation like Swift Australia at Dinmore which kills 3,500 head of cattle a day and which employs 2,200 people does not need to have people sitting around wondering whether QR is going to deliver. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028196"></A>
There will be no freight train into Longreach tomorrow. There will be none on Friday either. Private enterprise is filling the shortfall via road transport. This is not good enough. The storekeeper from Isisford continually comes into Longreach to pick up his goods from the rail line, and he gets there and there is no train. This is the situation that continually occurs. With an operation like Teys Brothers, of the 100 per cent of stock it buys in North Queensland, 60 per cent comes by rail on the northern line down to the works on the coast. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028201"></A>
This is about employment. This is about jobs, which this government has been on about. Doesn’t the government realise that companies have to plan, too? How would the people in Brisbane like it if every morning they could not get to work and were left standing on the platform because Queensland Rail could not deliver commuter trains? It is no different from what is happening in Western Queensland at the moment. Trains are being pulled off the line and put into other areas. They are blaming level-crossing crashes on a shortage of locomotives. What a load of hogwash that is! The other side of the equation is that the grain harvest from last year is still sitting in areas like the downs and Central Queensland. This year’s harvest is just about on us. </Hansard-Body>

 And you will have cattle on top of that. I am also reliably informed today that there will be no livestock trains running out of Roma and Dalby for the next two to three weeks. There will be another 15 to 20 B-doubles a day on those sale days which will also rocket down the Warrego Highway through Toowoomba, through all those towns in question, and down to Dinmore or Beenleigh or wherever they have to be processed. This is not good enough.</Hansard-Body>

This government talks about jobs and productivity. We in Western Queensland have had an absolute gutful. You have knocked country racing on the head in places like Quilpie. We are waiting to see an outcome for Aramac Hospital. We will probably have a 10c per litre increase in the price of fuel after today, and we have had a 16 per cent increase in electricity charges. It is all very well here in Brisbane where you do not pay much for anything, but in the bush we pay tenfold what you pay here and you have no damn idea of the cost of operations. It is the minority that provides for the majority. That is exactly what I am on about today. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms JOHNSTONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Townsville--ALP) (11.55 am): I rise to share with the House a matter of public interest in my electorate, but before I do that I wish to place on the record my condolences and sympathy to the family and friends of Peter le Grand. Many in this parliament would be aware of the sad news that Peter le Grand passed away in May after a diagnosis of cancer in only February this year. Peter will be known to many in this House. He was a former adviser and close personal friend to my predecessor, Mike Reynolds. Those who knew Peter will know that he was a passionate and fiercely loyal friend. He had an intellect equal to none. He held a breadth of knowledge and extraordinary skills in a range of areas, not the least his exceptional skills as a woodworker. In fact, some may even say that he was a master craftsman, and those who have visited the house that he and Linda built on Magnetic Island will understand what I mean.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028212"></A>
Peter was particularly vocal about Indigenous rights. He was an advocate for and a close friend to many on Palm Island, and I know that the Palm Island community is also grieving his loss. My deepest sympathies go to Peter’s beloved wife, Linda Wotten, who is a friend of both mine and the member for Mundingburra’s, and a friend to others in this House. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028214"></A>
Among his many interests was Peter’s love of Magnetic Island. His desire was to have as much of the island as possible protected from inappropriate development and to preserve the World Heritage values that the island has. Located eight kilometres off the mainland, Magnetic Island is not only an island suburb of the city of Townsville but also forms part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028215"></A>
An additional feature of the value Magnetic Island brings to the Great Barrier Reef marine World Heritage area is its ability to present to the public the World Heritage values that it contains. As stated in Kenchington and Hegerl’s 2005 report, ‘One of the four obligations of World Heritage properties is to make available for public viewing and enjoyment in an ecologically and culturally sustainable manner the outstanding universal values of properties.’ Magnetic Island contains no less than 19 World Heritage values that are identified as either uniquely or highly significant expressed components. These include geological and terrestrial diversity, mountainous terrain and shorelines of exceptional beauty, and significant natural habitats including the third largest number of rare flora and fauna of any continental islands within the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028217"></A>
The island is also home to endemic butterfly and skink subspecies. It is home to 13 species of animals classified as either rare or endangered. The island also contains middens and archaeological sites significant to the Wulgurukaba traditional owners of Magnetic Island, with Florence Bay recognised on the Register of the National Estate. As I stated earlier, not only does Magnetic Island provide all of these spectacular and unique World Heritage values, it is also a suburb of Townsville. It has a population of over 2,000 permanent residents on top of a large number of tourists visiting each year. This brings a challenge to all levels of government along with the local community to preserve, plan for and deliver practices that are sustainable and protect both the natural beauty, and the relaxed, peaceful and tranquil atmosphere. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028219"></A>
Kenchington and Hegerl also report that 97 per cent of visitors reported satisfaction in this area. I was fortunate to spend the day on Magnetic Island this past Saturday, 13 June. Included in the visits I undertook on Saturday was meeting with members of the Magnetic Island Community Development Association, an elder from the Wulgurukaba people, and members of the Magnetic Island RSL subbranch. All of these groups described to me the work that they are undertaking in one form or another to preserve the unique qualities and values that make this dry tropics continental island part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028253"></A>
Whether it was progressing legal protection of the island lands, sharing Aboriginal cultural history or weed eradication, all are making a contribution to the maintenance of the unique lifestyle that Magnetic Island has. In fact, island residents took part in World Ocean Day last Monday, 8 June by providing a range of activities reinforcing the natural value that the island brings to the region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028254"></A>
The government’s intention is to increase the size of the national park on Magnetic Island, subject to resolving native title issues currently under consideration. Significant areas of the unallocated state land on the island have been identified as being of high ecological value and these areas would make welcome additions to the current park. As the local member, I am very pleased to support these efforts. I look forward to working in partnership with the local islanders in ensuring that Maggie, as it is known to us locals, is developed in keeping with both the island and broader World Heritage values. This public asset is too valuable to waste. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr McARDLE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Caloundra--LNP) (12.00 pm): In late 2005 two documents related to Queensland Health were handed down--the Forster report and the Davies royal commission report. Both documents outlined one thing very clearly. They said that if we are to fix Queensland Health we have to start proper long-term planning and make certain that the plans are effective right across this great state of ours. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028259"></A>
One would have thought that in late 2005 this government, which had been in power since 1998, would have read those reports and understood very clearly the implications of continuing with the processes it had in place to date and that it would simply mean more of the same. This government was given a very clear warning that to do nothing but continue with its old practices would put more people’s lives at risk and planning would go askew. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028260"></A>
For a number of years the opposition has highlighted many faults in the planning by Queensland Health and many faults in the minister’s planning in relation to providing services to the people of Queensland. Nowhere has that been more brought home more clearly than in the recent report issued by the Auditor-General. It is a damning report with regard to the planning practices of Queensland Health from 2005 to the current date. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028263"></A>
We have to wonder why a government that has been in power for so long and which had the advantages of reading those two reports did nothing to change the processes within Queensland Health to deliver effective and efficient health services right across the state and to every single citizen in the state. At page 1 of the report it states that the audit identified fundamental weaknesses in current practices. This is after the opposition, the Forster review and the Davies royal commission said that to do the same was a disaster waiting to happen. When we read the report we see very clearly that the lie put about by this government in relation to population increases is simply rubbish. </Hansard-Body>

 I withdraw. On page 12 of this report it puts to rest the government’s statement that its planning processes have been delayed because of population increases. The report states--</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1028268"></A>
Generally service planning occurs in a three- to four-year period. However, planners are expected to understand long-term changes in service needs and to anticipate the likely impacts of population growth up to 15 years out. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028269"></A>
The citation is the department of health’s health service planning framework May 2007. Its own document says that any plan it puts out should take into account 15 years of population growth. We now know that the rubbish being peddled by this government, the Minister for Health and other ministers is simply that--rubbish--and belongs clearly in the bin. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028271"></A>
There are a number of hospitals right across this state that this government has got wrong. There is no question about that. Let us start with Cairns. It is a bandaid on a bandaid. What a travesty. Seven years ago those opposite built that hospital and now we find that more work has to be done. They have not had the gumption to build a new hospital. They have not had the planning nous to get out there and make a new hospital work for 15 years time. In two years time we will be back there again making more changes to the bandaid on the bandaid. </Hansard-Body>

Mr PITT</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mulgrave--ALP) (12.05 pm): The FNQ 2031 regional statutory plan is the blueprint that will guide the growth in Far North Queensland through the next 20 years. It will create jobs, limit urban sprawl and protect the region’s natural beauty. The plan also puts more than 99 per cent of Far North Queensland off limits to urban development. This means future generations of Queenslanders and tourists will be able to continue to enjoy the region’s natural beauty, from the World Heritage listed Wet Tropics to the Great Barrier Reef.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028283"></A>
People from right across Far North Queensland had their say and helped shape this plan. The Bligh government listened to close to 1,000 submissions on the draft plan and made changes to create more certainty for the tourism industry in these tough times. There were significant changes to deliver stronger environmental protection as well as some real wins for farmers. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028284"></A>
If those opposite had won government, they would have scrapped this award-winning regional plan and handed the future of Far North Queensland over to the development industry, meaning decisions largely based on profitability. Taxpayers and ratepayers would have to pick up the bill for infrastructure and essential services that should really have been met by developers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028285"></A>
I am very excited and privileged to be the state member for Mulgrave at a time that is crucial to managing population growth and planning for future schools, essential services and green space for sport and recreation. Our focus is now on implementation of the plan in order to achieve the outcomes that the community is seeking and the targets it has set the government for the region.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028286"></A>
Three-quarters of new homes identified in FNQ 2031 will be around Cairns, particularly in a new master planned community located between Edmonton and Gordonvale. The 1,200 hectare site is known as the Mount Peter area. It is the priority urban growth corridor for Cairns and has been identified as the last remaining land in the Cairns area with few natural constraints. It is expected to provide a mix of housing types and densities for up to 50,000 people. Led by the Cairns Regional Council, this project represents one of the largest master planning exercises undertaken in Queensland. The council is already hard at work doing the planning to shape this future community. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028289"></A>
Over 100 people attended an inquiry by design workshop in February of this year. Several key issues emerged from the inquiry by design workshop that need further consideration and have already generated some debate, such as management of the riparian corridors along waterways and integration of a rapid transit system with residential development. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028290"></A>
During the election campaign I expressed concerns that the workshop highlighted some inconsistencies between regional planning processes. For example, the Mount Peter master plan assumes a population growth of only 35,000 people and FNQ 2031 projects 50,000. A reduced population figure may contribute to a housing affordability crisis for future residents as infrastructure charges will be borne by fewer people. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028291"></A>
Mount Peter will be supported by a new town centre and enterprise precinct at Edmonton, but it must be more than just a dormitory suburb, still reliant on the rest of Cairns for employment. The attraction of major businesses as well will generate significant employment and may also reduce traffic congestion by removing the need for many people to travel daily into Cairns. However, a series of subregional retail hubs should be established between Edmonton and Gordonvale instead of simply enabling highly concentrated retail development. This will promote opportunities for small business and ensure community services remain accessible. Both outcomes can be delivered through careful planning. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028325"></A>
The Bligh government’s commitment to the construction of a second major hospital in the southern suburbs of Cairns will also have a significant impact on residential and retail planning. Like many, I want to see my home town of Gordonvale continue to grow, but not to the extent that has been laid out thus far. The Mount Peter master plan must deliver measured growth to Gordonvale without destroying the uniqueness of its character. Residents should have the opportunity to work, live and play in a vibrant community that has character of its own. I have made a commitment to work with division 1 councillor Paul Gregory on a Gordonvale area plan which would require significant community input.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028330"></A>
The inquiry by design process also flagged the future of the cane tramway system and its interaction with development in the area. At this stage of the planning process, major retail growth centres are sited in such a way that may render the cane rail nonviable, thus impacting negatively on the sugar industry. The long-term viability of the Mulgrave Central Mill could be put in jeopardy if the Mount Peter master plan does not get it right. Now more than ever we should not forget that more than 1,200 jobs in the Cairns region and the livelihoods of many farming families depend on the ongoing operations of the mill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028335"></A>
There is still a long way to go before the planning for Mount Peter is set in stone. The process will continue over the next two years, with large scale physical development of the corridor expected to commence after that and continue for at least the next 20 years. The future of Far North Queensland is at a crossroad, and I am pleased that I am able to play a leadership role at such a pivotal time in the region’s development. This government will continue to work with the Cairns Regional Council and landowners to ensure the structure plan adequately reflects the planning needs of the community and its future growth. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr FOLEY</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Maryborough--Ind) (12.10 pm): I rise to bring to the attention of the House the fact that this afternoon’s budget is going to give us an unparalleled opportunity in Queensland. There has been much conjecture in recent months about whether the Premier and the Treasurer have been talking about the doom and gloom of the budget in an attempt to soften the blow, so that it is not quite as bad as people think. I guess that is a little bit like banging your head against the wall while punching your fists against the wall at the same time and then saying, ‘It doesn’t hurt so much. It’s only my head!’</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028341"></A>
In this afternoon’s budget there is an unparalleled opportunity to save money. It is called ‘scrap the Traveston Dam’. We do not need this dam. It is an ill-thought-out dam. It is an environmental disaster that nobody wants. We have never had a time when we were colder and wetter than we are at the moment. In the context of Queensland trying to save money, the government should scrap the dam in order to save $2 billion and therefore it would not have to sell off as many Queensland assets. Once you sell off Queensland assets, you are selling off the farm. Once you sell the family farm, that is just it. It is just madness. In the six years that I have been in this House I have never seen more people angry about a particular policy decision--from all sides of politics, particularly Labor voters--than Queenslanders are at the thought of the Premier selling off Queensland assets. It just does not make any sense.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028343"></A>
We have already spent about $500 million on resumptions and associated work just to get to the stage of being able to build this dam. The project still has yet to fully satisfy the state Coordinator-General’s request for further information and it has to go through the feds. However, I come back to my original point: if the government scraps the dam, it will have a couple of billion dollars that it does not need to sell off state assets to get. This is remarkable in that we have never been in a time when we have seen such unprecedented global meltdown, and that is true. No-one denies that. But to sell off assets to counter that and then going ahead with the Traveston Dam just does not make any sense at all. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028345"></A>
The state government has also acknowledged that $20 million of a $50 million engineering design contract that it let without tender has also been exhausted. I believe that this dam will become the white elephant in the room. It will become the albatross hanging around the necks of the Treasurer and the Premier and, in fact, the Queensland government. It will continue to cost more and more and more, and it is entirely inappropriate to be spending those sorts of dollars on an unnecessary asset and at the same time selling off other assets.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028346"></A>
Much has been made about global warming, and I want to inform the House that I am not a global warming sceptic. It is very clear that we have global warming; what is unclear is the real cause of it. I have just finished reading a book on global warming by Ian Plimer called <Hansard-Italic>

. I would commend all members in the House to read that book by this Australian based geologist. As he says, drill down into the earth and you will see. Where are some of the largest number of marine fossils in Australia? In the middle of Australia, up in the high hills. Australia has been covered with water. There is climate change. Climate change is an ongoing thing.</Hansard-Body>

Mr FOLEY:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 Before members rubbish it too much, they should tell me if they have read the book. Geology is a very accurate science because you can simply drill down into the earth’s core and accurately show exactly what the climate conditions were at what period of time. We call it climate change rather than global warming, because we are cooler than ever in terms of weather with a much higher level of rainfall. Again, I tell the government that this afternoon there is an opportunity to save $2-plus billion off the budget by scrapping this ridiculous dam and to reinstate some credibility for those people in regional Queensland. Here is the opportunity. It is a double PR benefit for the government, because $2 billion saved by scrapping a dam is $2 billion that does not have to be raised by selling off assets and selling off the family farm--something that nobody wants, particularly government voters. I call on the minister and the Treasurer to accurately address that issue. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Ms STONE</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Springwood--ALP) (12.15 pm): At a time when everyone is talking about how to be green, our thoughts usually go to saving water, recycling our rubbish, cutting back on our energy use and other things around the house we can do to be greener. Today I am going to speak about another part of the cycle of life where we can be green: death. In Canada each year more than 320,000 litres of embalming chemicals, 150,000 tonnes of reinforced concrete, nine tonnes of steel and three million board feet of hardwoods are buried in Canadian cemeteries. Most are derived from materials used just once, and I would think this description is probably accurate for Australia’s cemeteries. With the increase in our population, cemeteries have become vast acres with all care left to the councils and the trusts that look after them. With the growing popularity of cremation memorial walls, manicured lawns and perfect pest-free gardens have become part of our urban landscape.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028355"></A>
I put this to members today: as Queenslanders who care about our environment, can we continue to afford not to look at funeral practices and the impact they have on our environment? As responsible Queenslanders, we need to encourage the use of coffins that emit less greenhouse gases when cremated and no poisonous chemicals when buried. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059233"></A>
As Queenslanders we need to ensure that people have the right to carry out their funeral wishes depending on their personal, cultural or traditional practices and ensure that their body disposal has as little impact on the environment as possible. Yet with all of the changes that have happened in the funeral industry in the last 60 years, people still ask to be buried in a simple cardboard box under the shade of a big old tree. In the UK, USA, Canada and many other countries, this desire is becoming a reality as more and more natural bush cemeteries become an asset to the natural environment they are a part of. Natural bush cemeteries allow for people to be buried with minimum impact on the earth and provide the earth with the natural nutrients to rejuvenate plant growth and encourage the continuing sanctuary of the native flora and fauna that are suffering at our increasing need to urbanise our bushland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1059234"></A>
Australia currently has three working natural bush cemeteries: one in Tasmania, one in South Australia and one in Lismore. Unlike the lawn cemetery, there is not the constant need to use pesticides or mow. Precious metals, rare timbers or toxic chemicals cannot be buried within the grounds. People who chose green burials understand and welcome the fact that they can only be buried in a shroud or coffin made from natural organic materials such as untreated plantation timber, woven wicker or recycled cardboard. They also respect that no cements or marbles will be used to mark their final resting place. They accept that, with respect to their surrounding bushland, stone native to the area can only be used for their burial markers. However, the savvy techno can have a GPS device placed in their hands so their families can return to honour the bushland settings and their loved one.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1028362"></A>
The Gold Coast City Council is in the preliminary stages of starting Queensland’s first natural bushland cemetery, and I am told the natural burial site will be on the site of an old quarry to be filled with suitable soil so that bodies can decompose and provide valuable nutrients so as to encourage the rejuvenation of native flora. Encouraging the Queensland funeral industry and cemeteries to include ecofriendly options for families is not difficult. Coffins made from recycled cardboard and woven wicker and burial shrouds are already available in Queensland. Sadly, in Queensland last year, out of the 24,500 coffins that were used fewer than 100 of them would have been sound ecochoices.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031911"></A>
In the USA, nearly 75 per cent of coffins are made of steel and many coffins are lined with copper or zinc. Approximately 200 million pounds of steel are used in caskets each year. Eco-friendly coffins such as LifeArt coffins are available in Australia. They use 90 per cent less virgin wood fibre than a traditional coffin. These coffins are made from up to 97 per cent recovered fibre waste, such as post-consumer recycled paper and sugarcane waste. They do not contain adhesives that release formaldehyde. Testing has shown that they release significantly fewer carbon emissions into the environment--in fact, half the emissions of a standard coffin. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031913"></A>
A virtual carbon-neutral crematorium is operational in South Australia, but I do not believe that Queensland’s crematoriums can make that claim. As Queensland’s population is growing and we are an ageing population, inevitably we will see an increase in deaths per annum. So I say to members that the next time someone says to them that they want to be buried in a cardboard box under a shady tree they should tell them that they can. I ask members to remind people that they can do that and people will thank them for helping to ensure that future generations can enjoy our environment. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr HOPPER</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Condamine--LNP) (12.20 pm): I want to follow on from the very cunning interjection that the member for Toowoomba South made to the Premier as she spoke this morning and also the comments about Queensland Rail that were made earlier by the member for Gregory in his speech. The Bligh government’s slash and burn of QR’s freight services has come to a head, with all freight services west of Toowoomba cancelled last week. Time and again, passenger, general freight, grain and cattle trains are cancelled, with little or no explanation other than, ‘We’ve had a breakdown,’ or ‘We haven’t any locos,’ when the truth of the matter is that this Bligh government has neglected repairs, maintenance and upgrades to these essential services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031917"></A>
We have had three crops in a row on the Darling Downs. It is going to take three years to cart that produce off the Downs. Now we are going to see Queensland Rail privatised. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked, where is the union movement on this issue? Where are the grassroots people? Why have they not come out and slammed the Bligh government for its attitude towards these services--the assets that are owned by the people of Queensland? Where is the Rail, Tram and Bus Union on this matter? No wonder the Deputy Leader of the Opposition called them a mob of gutless fairies. We can understand why. Where are they? Where is the Minister for Primary Industries on this matter? The minister is sitting in the chamber. What have you done to the other--</Hansard-Body>

Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER</Hansard-Member-Up>
 (Ms Johnstone): Order! Please direct your comments through the chair. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031920"></A>
<Hansard-Member-Up>
Mr HOPPER:</Hansard-Member-Up>
 What has the Minister for Primary Industries done in this area of freight of consumable products? We heard the member for Gregory talk about the trouble that our meatworks are facing. The upshot of this failure is directly affecting two of Queensland’s--and Australia’s--largest meat processors: Swift’s at Dinmore and Teys Brothers, which operates plants in north, central and southern Queensland. Indeed, this Bligh government is putting the nation’s largest meatworks, Swift’s at Dinmore, under a cloud, with management saying that jobs at the plant are at risk. In the current climate, the comments from Swift’s manager, John Berry, that blue-collar jobs are at risk should be ringing alarm bells very loudly in the ears of all of those members opposite. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031924"></A>
The Bligh government is very happy to subsidise non-profitable sections of QR’s operations. Last week we heard that Citytrain will receive $500 million in subsidies this year. That is happening at a time when QR’s non-coal freight services are being chopped. Excuses from this government come thick and fast, but the facts are that these vital freight services, which underpin western communities and the Darling Downs region and service vital export-earning industries, are being neglected and run down and that this has been going on for years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031925"></A>
These excuses from the government come thick and fast. In the past decade, the number of cattle-loading rail points across Queensland has been cut from 300 to just 17 and the number of cattle K-wagons has halved to just 500. At the same time, grain wagons have been left to rust. Now our grain growers and grain handlers cannot get trains to get their grain to port. Industry leaders are saying that, at the current rate, it could take three years to move the grain. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031926"></A>
Everyone knows that this government is broke. It is madly trying to flog off any asset that it can to cover the massive $74 billion debt that it has racked up, $65 billion of which was there before the economic crisis started. Every day in this chamber we hear those opposite talk about Queensland being in the state it is in because of the economic crisis. It is disgusting. We are now faced with the assets that the people of Queensland own being flogged off. The money generators of this state are going to be sold and privatised. What does privatisation do? It looks for the mighty dollar and services in the bush will be put to the back end. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031927"></A>
What is going on with QR’s freight services is truly a false economy. By its actions and its budget that we will see this afternoon, this government has betrayed the grassroots people and its own fundamental principles. It is costing jobs, pushing hundreds more semitrailers and B-doubles onto already congested roads, especially the Toowoomba range crossing. We all know that coal is king. That is where the big dollars and royalty payments lie for the government. That is fine, but this government also needs to be protecting export jobs and especially labour-intensive industries such as meat processing and the produce that comes from the Darling Downs. The Bligh government needs to start doing a far better job of looking after our $4 billion a year cattle industry, our grain industry and our western communities. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mrs ATTWOOD</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Mount Ommaney--ALP)<Hansard-Bold>
 </Hansard-Bold>
(12.25 pm): I would like to praise the wonderful work that is done by many non-government organisations in relation to getting people with a disability into the workforce. People with a disability are important. They can be our sons, daughters, husbands or wives, a keen sportsman, a valuable employee, or our next door neighbour. In fact, one in five people living in Queensland is identified as having a disability. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031931"></A>
The job market can be very tough, especially for people with a disability. Overall, during the past decade as more jobs were created every year workforce participation in Queensland has been improving. But against that backdrop of overall employment improvement over previous years, some community members still found it difficult to secure meaningful employment. Now, as we face this global financial crisis, this problem will be exacerbated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031932"></A>
Some employers focus only on the person’s disability, not the person’s ability, while others are simply not prepared to give job applicants with a disability a fair go. Our government is committed to making the workplace more accessible to people with a disability as well as fostering more welcoming and inclusive communities--communities where people with a disability are free from the barriers that prevent them from equitable participation in all aspects of community life. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031933"></A>
Recently, I had the opportunity to attend one of 12 consultations regarding the new Queensland plan for mental health across Queensland which took place in Bundaberg. Disability Services has, as part of a major investment in mental health services, developed a number of initiatives targeted at sector development, focusing on workforce development, leadership and government development, and infrastructure development. We are working to ensure that employers and communities are more welcoming and accepting. In that regard, the federal government provides a number of incentives to employees. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031935"></A>
The provision of job training services and transition to employment programs for people with a disability are important contributions to making our society more inclusive and, therefore, a better society. We all have abilities and providing the opportunity to develop what abilities an individual has into something better is a great gift to a person. People with a disability do not simply want access to the community; they want to be truly part of it. They want perceptions to change to such a degree that inclusion is the norm and difference is welcomed, rather than merely being accepted. I applaud those organisations that work hard to ensure that that happens and that people with a disability feel empowered. They are sending a message to others in the community that theirs is an inclusive business. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1031937"></A>
Recently, I had the opportunity to visit Westside Community Services at Acacia Ridge. They have initiated an extraordinary program called My Life. My Life is a program for people with an intellectual and/or psychiatric impairment who wish to learn independent living skills. Participants gain skills to enable them to access opportunities in the community such as education, recreation and employment. The program was developed by Westside Social Programs in conjunction with Westside Training. Westside Training is a registered training organisation that provides accredited and non-accredited training to people who are disadvantaged in the workforce. Westside Social Programs also works closely with sister organisation Comepass employment service, which is a disability employment network provider with 18 years experience in helping job seekers with a disability find and retain work. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034676"></A>
Sometimes they refer Comepass clients to My Life so they can develop additional social skills prior to entering the workforce. Conversely, some My Life participants have been able to gain employment after graduation. This program won the minister’s training initiative award in 2006. Westside’s main focus and their major success has been getting graduates of the program into part-time or full-time employment opportunities, but the course also results in people moving out of home into shared and independent living and travelling independently. It is currently putting plans into action for reunions and other social events that keep and renew the friendships made through the My Life program. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1060399"></A>
I have spoken to many participants of the program and they have told me how valuable it has been for them. They have more self-confidence, feel more empowered and enthusiastically look forward to getting involved in social activities and being more independent. All research indicates that the single most important way in which barriers can be broken down is for people with a disability to secure and retain paid employment. <Hansard-Speech-End>

I join with other members in congratulating the Speaker and Deputy Speakers on their election. I extend my sincere thanks to the people of Springwood for electing me for a fourth term to be their voice in the Queensland parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034684"></A>
Today I rise in this place as the longest serving member for Springwood. No other member has ever been elected for a third term to the seat of Springwood. So it is very humbling and a great honour to have been voted in by the people of Springwood for a fourth term and to know that they have once again placed their faith and trust in me. I assure the people of Springwood that their confidence will not be misplaced. I am strongly committed to putting Springwood first and ensuring that our local issues are at the forefront of government decision making and policy development. </Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034688"></A>
One of the first issues raised with me by constituents in the northern part of Rochedale South was the need for more buses. I have gone on a peak-hour morning bus ride with residents to get a feel for the bus routes and to make myself available to residents to discuss any matters. I thank Cynthia Gay for assisting me in this very mobile office and look forward to having more mobile bus offices. I was able to put forward their requests and I am happy to report that some have already been implemented and that there have been service improvements for Rochedale South. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034689"></A>
Improving public transport is something that I have always worked hard to achieve, and I know that there is more to be done in all parts of the Springwood electorate. I am pleased to see that the focus has been put on improving weekend services, with now a 15-minute service frequency between the hours of 8 am and 5 pm. This will greatly increase travel options and connectivity with existing services in Logan. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034690"></A>
The state government has recently invested $1.5 million to improve services, combat overcrowding and improve frequency of services in Logan City. This has included nine new low-floor air-conditioned buses and additional services each weekday and on weekends, giving a capacity for an additional 1,000 passengers on weekdays and an additional 5,000 passengers on weekends. I know there is more to be done and I am committed to working hard to continue building on these improvements.</Hansard-Body>

I am certainly looking forward to continuing to work with all the schools in the electorate. I look forward to working with the two new schools that have become part of the Springwood electorate, Rochedale South State School and Chisholm Catholic College at Cornubia. In regard to early childhood education, during the election campaign I noted the LNP’s policy in respect of kindergartens on school grounds. I was shocked to read a media release by the then shadow minister for social inclusion that they would scrap Labor’s plan for 240 new and expanded kindergartens around the state. In an article in the <Hansard-Italic>
Reporter </Hansard-Italic>
newspaper, the LNP candidate suggested the kindergarten would be supported if it could be demonstrated it was needed. That only proved how out of touch the LNP are with the people of Springwood. I know that the community strongly believes this kindy is needed. The Bligh government has a clear early education policy and it does include a new $1.6 million kindergarten at Rochedale South State School. This new kindergarten reflects local community views that schools need to become community hubs with a range of services and programs that would benefit students, parents and the local community as a whole.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034692"></A>
There is a lot of maintenance work being done in both primary and high schools and both private and public schools all around the electorate, and at long last we have a federal government committed to public education and committed to assisting all schools. I take this opportunity to thank the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, for taking an interest and acting to make sure our schools are getting their fair share of resources. For far too long under the Howard government they did without their fair share of federal funding. Every school in the Springwood electorate is a great success story due to the hard work of principals, teachers, staff, students and the very hard work of active Parents and Citizens and Parents and Friends groups. I look forward to continuing to work with all of them and to keep reporting to the House the great achievements that are happening in our schools. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034693"></A>
A great community spirit is also found in the Neighbourhood Watch groups in the Springwood electorate. With the expansion of the boundaries of the electorate I gained two more Neighbourhood Watch groups. I congratulate John Griffiths, Rochedale South Slacks Creek 9 Neighbourhood Watch, and Lindy McDermott, Slacks Creek 15 Neighbourhood Watch, and their members for running very successful groups. I welcome them to the Springwood electorate and I look forward to working with them. It is well known that suburbs that have active Neighbourhood Watch groups usually have less crime and generally safer communities. I thank all the Neighbourhood Watch groups in Springwood for their hard work in making our communities safer and I look forward to working with them.</Hansard-Body>

Our community has worked very hard to protect the Daisy Hill State Forest for future generations. Earlier this year that work was in jeopardy due to an ill-thought-out LNP policy. Members can imagine how concerned the community was when it heard the news that the Daisy Hill State Forest could play home to a trail bike park. In January the LNP announced a policy to introduce dedicated bike parks around Queensland, possibly by reclaiming state forests. A local newspaper journalist even phoned the opposition’s office to confirm that the LNP was not opposed to resuming state forest land such as the Daisy Hill State Forest reserve. They confirmed this to be true. She then asked whether they could rule out the Daisy Hill State Forest, and the answer was that nothing could be ruled out--another example of how out of touch the LNP is with the people of Springwood. The Bligh Labor government continues to improve the koala centre facilities, BBQ facilities and educational facilities at Daisy Hill State Forest. We are building horse float car parks and walking track facilities and much, much more to improve the Daisy Hill State Forest for everyone to enjoy, yet the LNP cannot rule out plans to place trail bike tracks within the grounds of this unique part of Queensland. </Hansard-Body>

Another major important infrastructure project in my electorate is the M1 upgrade. The state and federal Labor governments have each committed dollars towards improving the Pacific Motorway on priority sections between the Gateway Motorway and Tugun. The state government has got on with the job and ensured planning, project designs and public consultation have continued. Main Roads will commence construction of the Winnetts Road and Loganlea Road Interchange as soon as possible. This will improve access onto and off the motorway for better traffic flow and safety. This is the priority section of the project, and I call on the new Minister for Main Roads to please get construction started as soon as possible. It is now time to see machinery out on the motorway and the project begin. We cannot afford to wait any longer.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1034696"></A>
Like many in the community, I was very concerned to read that there are about 50 suburban pubs applying for extended trading hours. In general, I do not believe there is community support for extended hotel trading hours. In fact, I hear more support for reducing them, especially at the suburban pubs. While I do believe there is a need for late-night entertainment venues, pubs and clubs, I do not believe the suburban local pub is suitable for this purpose. I believe it is something that this government will need to do more work on during this term to get an outcome suitable to the community.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1034697"></A>
It is, of course, our police and emergency services officers who will have to deal with the antisocial behaviour that will be associated with extended hotel trading hours. I take this opportunity to thank our police in Logan for the great work that they do. I also thank the ambulance officers and fire and rescue officers who look after us very well. We are fortunate to have such dedicated officers who provide us with a first-class service. This term I am looking forward to telling the House of the progress of the new Woodridge Fire Station. I also want to mention our Logan SES officers, who have been incredibly busy this year. They, too, are giving our community a first-class service. It is a real comfort to all of us to know they are there for us when we need them. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1034698"></A>
The fall in the construction and building industry has been hard hitting for many in my electorate. Recently in a local newspaper article Rochedale South was a suburb listed as having a large number of tradespeople living in it. It is important that we as a government make sure we keep our capital program working, that we keep building and maintenance jobs going in our local schools and that we ensure we encourage the use of local tradespeople for these jobs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037458"></A>
I also want to take this opportunity to point out that while many of us have been dancing around when the housing mortgage interest rates have been dropping, our business people have been getting hit more and more with higher commercial interest rates. It is a vicious cycle and I only wish the banks would look at the whole picture and come on board to assist our small to medium businesses to keep going, keeping people working and families supported. We all need to pull together. These are tough times and that is why it is important that as a government we keep doing whatever we can to keep the Capital Works Program going and keep jobs for Queenslanders. </Hansard-Body>

Like all election campaigns there are stories to tell. One of the most memorable stories for me was that of a Springwood constituent who, on the Friday morning before the election, came running in to the office to show us the <Hansard-Italic>
Courier-Mail</Hansard-Italic>
 headline which stated ‘Voters Dump Labor’. She said, ‘I’m so furious with this headline that I went straight down to the news agency and cancelled my <Hansard-Italic>

 delivery.’ To this day she is still very proud of doing that and tells everyone she meets that she is <Hansard-Italic>

 free. </Hansard-Body>

I have to thank many people who helped me during the election campaign and throughout the years. While I have tried very hard to list everyone who helped, I realise that the time limit I have is not enough to do so. However, I will name a few. My electorate staff give 110 per cent effort at all times and I thank them for their support and good work. I know that they are listening; thank you, thank you, thank you. My wonderful campaign director, Melissa Hockey, did a brilliant job. She is a fantastic young woman with a great future.

I thank the best EVPV team ever, Graeme, Rod and mum and Dawn. They did a wonderful job. To all those who letterboxed, assisted in mobile offices, put up signs, folded and stuffed envelopes, coordinated volunteers, went on booth rosters and did all the jobs that go into an election campaign, I thank you all. I thank Peter and Grace at KamKoon for a delicious election night meal and to all those who helped with food for election day and night. I thank Eric, a letterboxer extraordinaire. I think the final figure was 2,700. He is unbelievable! I could not have done it without all those who worked on booths. To Dan and Roy, what a duo! They are a Logan-known duo. I thank them for all their support and assistance.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1037464"></A>
I thank the ALP organisers and ALP members for their assistance. I thank the unions and their members who assisted me. A special thanks goes to my union, the BLF. I thank the community groups and sporting organisations that always get out there and support me. To Matt and the South Australian crew, thanks for choosing Springwood. We loved having you here. Matt did a great job. He was a great help and I appreciate all his hard work. I am running out of time so I simply say ‘thank you’ to everyone.  I thank my friends who are always there when I need them, and especially my mum Gloria, my nana Gwen and all my family members. Once again they were there for me, not only during the campaign and on election day, but always through the tough times and the good times. I love them dearly and thank them. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1037465"></A>
I finish with this promise to my constituents: I will continue to hold mobile offices throughout the electorate. I will also continue to grant writing seminars and provide information for sporting and community groups. I will continue holding seniors’ information morning teas. I will continue to deliver Meals on Wheels and my regular segment with our local community radio station. I will continue to keep the electorate updated with the regular newsletter, <Hansard-Italic>
Barbara Stone’s Springwood Update</Hansard-Italic>
. Attending as many meetings and community events in the local community as possible is still a very big priority for me. The most important job I have is to consult with the people of Springwood. I now look forward to the next three years and continuing working with all levels of government to ensure that our local community promotes individual, family and community vitality that respects diversity and is at the forefront of government decision making. <Hansard-Speech-End>

Mr CHOI</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Capalaba--ALP) (12.43 pm): It is an honour to stand here today as a member of the 53rd Parliament of Queensland. At the outset I take this opportunity to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the electorate I represent in the beautiful area of the Redlands. In fact, only a few weeks ago I represented the Premier at the Q150 celebration of our history, that is, the 150 years that have passed since separation from New South Wales at North Stradbroke Island, which is known as Minjerribah to the traditional owners. Straddie is one of the island jewels of Moreton Bay, known for thousands of years as Quandamooka. That name incorporates the islands, as well as the bay. On the day of the Q150 celebration the elders gathered included descendants of the original inhabitants of Moreton Island, known as Moorgumpin. Therefore, I pay respect to the Minjerribah Moorgumpin elders, not only for their custodianship of the land and water we call Moreton Bay but also for the friendship they have extended to me and my office in the past seven to eight years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037470"></A>
I congratulate the Governor on her appointment to that important position. It is fantastic to see another female taking a leadership role in public office. I am confident that the Governor, with her easygoing and friendly persona, will excel in her role as the representative of Her Majesty in Queensland. I also congratulate the Premier on being the first female Premier directly elected by the people. 26 February 2009 was an historical day because the last glass ceiling in politics was shattered and a premier was elected based on ability, leadership and ideas, irrespective of gender. On election night after celebrating with my supporters I left them early and, for the very first time, went to the tally room. I wanted to be part of history, to be in the room when Premier Bligh claimed victory. I was then able to go home and tell my three daughters that if they work hard and believe in themselves, they too can be the Premier or even the Prime Minister of this great land. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037471"></A>
The election campaign of 2009 was very different from those I have experienced in the past. A lot of changes had taken place. As the chair of the Queensland Small Business Advisory Council, I have had the opportunity to travel around Queensland. Twelve months ago, wherever I went businesspeople told me that the biggest issue for them was difficulties in hiring and keeping skilled labourers and staff. How things have changed in just a few months. These days it is a challenge to keep a business viable, maintain turnover and hang on to staff to ensure that the skills, knowledge and experiences that have been accumulated in the past are not lost in this difficult economic time.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037472"></A>
On election day the people of Queensland made a clear choice. They are looking for a government that has a plan to protect their jobs. This government will do that with a four-point plan. The first step is our commitment to keep driving the record $17 billion building program. That is $2 million per hour per day per week per month to protect and create 119,000 jobs. It is the largest building program in the country, keeping 119,000 people in jobs and creating demand in the economy. The government will continue to plan for and invest in the infrastructure that enables the economy to grow: roads, schools, hospitals, railways and public transport. We will also build social infrastructure. The government is committed to providing water security in South-East Queensland. The world’s largest water grid is now in place and is delivering water across the region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037473"></A>
The second part of the jobs plan is to prepare for the recovery from the global storm by developing skills for the future. The government will expand the skills base so Queensland is ready to lead Australia into the next period of growth. The government will launch the biggest local expansion of skills and training ever, investing more than $400 million to create almost 150,000 new training places. It will ensure that 10 per cent of workers on state and federal infrastructure projects are apprentices and trainees. The government will reward employers who hire apprentices or trainees with a 125 per cent payroll tax rebate to build skills and encourage businesses to retain workers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037474"></A>
The third step of the government’s jobs plan is the creation of new jobs in industries of the future like the solar and LNG industries, and through a renewed focus on our traditional strengths like the tourism, agriculture and resources sectors. The government will also work hard to create a gas superhighway to help support the LNG industry, securing a land corridor for an underground gas pipeline to proposed LNG plants. Harnessing the power of the sun in a state with such an abundance of sunshine is also a key commitment of the government. The government will create jobs in the solar energy sector through the new Solar Hot Water Program. It will provide 200,000 solar systems at a fraction of the retail price, cutting Queenslanders’ power bills by a third and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least two tonnes every year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1037475"></A>
The fourth part of the government’s plan is to develop new job programs like the Green Army. The government will create 3,000 jobs, putting an army of unemployed people to work in our National Parks, green spaces and waterways. In doing so, we will help address two of the most important issues of modern times: protecting jobs and protecting the environment. The government moves quickly to face the challenges of the world with a plan and determination. </Hansard-Body>

Having said that, no election campaign can be successful without numerous volunteers and supporters, and my campaign was no different. I would like to thank some of the people on my campaign team for the wonderful things they have done for me behind the scenes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040221"></A>
Firstly, to my electorate officer, Lisa: thank you for all your hard work and long hours during the campaign. You had the enormous job of running the office every day during the campaign. Keeping the constituents happy and keeping me happy is no small job, and you manage to do both really well every day. To David Martin, thank you for your tireless effort of driving my A-frame trailer all over the electorate and making yourself available at any time, day or night, to lend support wherever needed. I also thank you for your amazing production line of quality A-frames for all our corflutes in a matter of days without being asked. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040222"></A>
To Pam and Barry Lenthall--by the way, Barry is recovering from triple bypass surgery at the moment with Pam by his side--thank you for all your support to my office staff during their first election campaign. Pam, your patient phone manner during the campaign is one of the things I will always remember. No matter how worried or upset the caller was you always managed to calm them down and give them the information they were looking for. I thank you for that. Barry, thank you for your early-morning starts with me at the railway stations. Your faith in the party kept us on track. I promise you some KFC after your surgery, provided your wife allows me to do so. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040223"></A>
To Alf Jones, thank you for your support and for the early-morning starts with me. Thank you for singing to keep me on my feet and keep me going. To Alan Roche, my campaign manager: thank you for your support. Your phone calls were mostly at the most inappropriate times, but nonetheless it was very important that you made sure I had done all the things that needed to be done.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040224"></A>
I give a special thank you to all my ‘special ladies’--Alex Shrubsole, Judy Lunn, Dee Lim and Claudia Lloyd-West. I would like to thank their husbands for allowing them to come and support me during the campaign period. Without your help in my office, many of the little jobs would never have been completed on time. I am very grateful. </Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1040225"></A>
To Chris Grealy, you are always a quiet achiever behind the scenes and you simply get on and do your job and do it well. Thank you to you and Joy for your faith and support.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040226"></A>
Thank you to all my booth captains. They managed the polling booths well on the day. They are worth millions to me. To Edward Bennett, Frank Chambers, Pam and Barry Lenthall, Alan Roche, Miguel Diaz, Marina Williams, Matt Sellars, Richard Tetley, Tony Wehl and Virginia Mort: your efforts in keeping things running smoothly on polling day were fantastic.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040227"></A>
To the Wong family, from the youngest to the oldest, to the interstate visitors who drove all the way from Sydney just to be here on polling day to support the Choi team for Capalaba: thank you for your support and hard work. And, yes, my next truck--the famous Choi’s mobile--will have power steering and air conditioning! </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040228"></A>
To my colleagues Phil Weightman and John English: thank you for your wonderful contribution to the wellbeing of the people in the Redlands. Nothing can take that away from them. They were hard working and honest and the Redlands city area is better because of them. Their work will always be remembered. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040232"></A>
To my family, especially my wife and my children, Priscilla, Rachel and Claudia: I become a nightmare during election time; I know that. So I do apologise for being perhaps short tempered and I promise that I will take you for that holiday. It will come.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040233"></A>
To those in my electorate who have voted for me, a big thankyou. To those who have yet to vote for me, I promise to work harder to earn your trust and listen more attentively. </Hansard-Body>

Mr WETTENHALL</Hansard-Member-Electorate>
 (Barron River--ALP) (12.53 pm): It is a great honour to be re-elected for a second term to represent the people of Barron River in this the 53rd Queensland Parliament. Mr Deputy Speaker, I take this opportunity to congratulate the Speaker on his election to that high office. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040238"></A>
Since I first stood in this House in 2006, the economic environment affecting our state has changed dramatically. Precipitated by events overseas and beyond the control of the Australian or Queensland governments, economic growth has stalled and with it state government revenues have fallen. During a period of sustained economic growth over the previous decade, no-one did predict or could have predicted the reversal of our economic fortunes or the speed with which the global financial crisis has swept the globe. Most governments around the world have reacted to these circumstances by adjusting their policy settings to provide stimulus to their national and state economies. In Queensland, the Bligh Labor government has opted to maintain a record infrastructure investment throughout these tough times to protect the jobs of Queenslanders and build the schools, roads, hospitals, police stations and other vital public infrastructure to serve the needs of our growing population. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040239"></A>
Nearly $2.5 billion of Queensland government infrastructure projects are committed or have been commenced in the far northern region. I fully support this approach. Protecting the jobs of Queenslanders today is not only good economic policy but also the best social policy. No amount of welfare or other forms of government assistance can substitute for the benefits of gainful employment. The Cairns area is experiencing a spike in unemployment, and local job losses have occurred in the mining, construction, manufacturing and tourism industries. The far northern regional economy is particularly dependent on the tourism industry. One in five workers in tropical North Queensland depends on tourism, and one in 10 businesses relies directly on tourism for their survival. A recent report commissioned by the Australian government concluded that tourism generates $11,000 for every man, woman and child in the region. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040241"></A>
Of the top 20 tourism regions in Australia, the tropical North Queensland economy is the most reliant on tourism. Tourism is not just important for the tropical north but is also a vital industry throughout the state, directly employing about 119,000 Queenslanders. Seventy-five per cent of them are employed by small businesses. Domestic and international tourism contributes approximately $9 billion to the state economy and is second only to coal as an export earner. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040242"></A>
In recognition of the importance of the industry, the Bligh government has committed a further $38 million over three years to support regionally focused marketing activities and product development campaigns over and above the $137 million already committed to Tourism Queensland over the next three years. The new funding is also in addition to the $15 million per annum available to support the industry through the Queensland Investment Incentives Scheme. Some $6 million of the new funding will be used by Tourism Queensland to market major business, sporting and cultural events, and a further $1.8 million will be used for new and upgraded roadside infrastructure such as picnic and rest areas and tourism signage to support the drive market. As the Parliamentary Secretary for Tourism, I will be assisting the Minister for Tourism to implement the government’s policy priorities for the industry which over the next year are squarely focused on protecting jobs. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040248"></A>
In 2009, the Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation will also carry out a review of the 10-year Queensland Tourism Strategy to ensure its continuing relevance in the light of rapidly changing circumstances and to take advantage of opportunities presented by completed actions since the plan was adopted in 2006. Queensland has a great range and diversity of tourism products suited to every taste and budget. The product on offer is continually evolving but there is no doubt that our superb natural attractions such as our beaches, islands, rainforests and the World Heritage listed Great Barrier Reef are the big attractions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040251"></A>
With the support of government, new product will be developed, and I am particularly keen to see the continued growth of Indigenous tourism. There are no silver bullets to overcome the lack of opportunity for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to achieve economic independence. However, tourism is most definitely going to be part of that solution. The success of Tjabukai dance theatre from its early days in Kuranda through to its purpose-built facility in Smithfield in the Barron River electorate is a wonderful example of how to showcase the ancient Indigenous culture in a contemporary and entertaining way. Under the guidance of creative director David Hudson, Tjabukai is well placed to adapt to an evolving market for Indigenous tourism experiences. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040259"></A>
Although the way in which Indigenous culture is presented to tourists will change as the expectations and desires of tourists change, I have no doubt that tourists will continue to seek authentic experiences of Indigenous culture and country. The Bligh government’s support of bold new initiatives such as the proposed Dreaming track in Cape York demonstrates our determination to support new opportunities for Indigenous people to achieve economic security and independence. I intend to work closely with the member for Cook, Balkanu, the Cape York Land Council, the Cape York institute and traditional owners to make sure that the Dreaming track becomes a reality. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040264"></A>
Having regard to the time, I will conclude my brief remarks by simply recording a few thankyous. I would like to thank everyone who supported the re-election of the Bligh Labor government at the last election. In particular, I acknowledge the support of Labor Party members; trade unions; my campaign manager, Lesley Clark; and my parliamentary colleagues from the north--the member for Cairns, the member for Cook, the former member for Mulgrave and the newly elected member for Mulgrave. I also want to thank my wife and family for their ongoing love and support, without which I would be unable to carry out my responsibilities as a member of parliament. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1040267"></A>
Throughout Queensland’s and indeed the nation’s history, it has so often been Labor governments that people have turned to or relied upon in times of crisis. I am very mindful of those who placed their faith and trust in Labor at the helm as the Bligh government navigates our way through these uncharted economic waters. <Hansard-Speech-End>

‘The scope and need for ... development are obvious to all. In addition to creating assets of value to the community, the utilisation of funds for these purposes relieves unemployment in a most effective manner. Business is stimulated by the circulation of increased purchasing power which, in turn, augments demand for consumable goods.’</Hansard-Body>

This is a Budget about the future.</Hansard-Body>

It is not about tomorrow, but the future beyond.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>

It is the first Budget of a newly constituted government.</Hansard-Body>

ECONOMIC AND FISCAL OUTLOOK</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050259"></A>
Mr Speaker, there is almost universal acceptance that the globe is experiencing the most severe financial crisis since the 1930s.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050260"></A>
The synchronised and rapid deterioration that swept the globe will see global output contract for the first time since the Second World War.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050261"></A>
Twelve months ago Queensland’s major trading partners were forecast to grow by 3%, today they are forecast to contract by 3% in 2009.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050262"></A>
Our major trading partner, Japan, has recorded four consecutive quarters of negative growth. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050263"></A>
South Korea, Taiwan, the US, the UK, the Netherlands and Brazil are all in our top ten trading nations ... and all are in recession.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050264"></A>
The IMF forecasts the average unemployment rate of advanced economies will reach 9.2% in 2010.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050265"></A>
The synchronicity of the collapse in global demand has been countered by a synchronicity of effort by governments and central banks alike.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050266"></A>
Significant fiscal stimulus in concert with monetary policy easing has sought to inject and invite demand.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050267"></A>
Australia has been a stand out performer amongst our peers--before and since the global recession.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050268"></A>
And Queensland has stayed ahead of the nation.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050269"></A>
We have been out in front for 12 years, growing ahead of the nation and we are set to close off this most tumultuous of years with positive--albeit marginal--growth of %.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050270"></A>
Just as the nation expects to enter into a sustained period of contraction next year, we expect to see the Queensland economy also experiencing negative growth.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050271"></A>
The Queensland economy is forecast to contract by % in 2009/10. Once again this forecast will still see our economy outperforming the nation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050272"></A>
Our modern, diversified economy has provided capacity to absorb the full effects. Western Australia, which is more reliant on resources, is forecast to contract by 1%.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050273"></A>
Growth in Queensland is forecast to return the following year, but remain below trend.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050274"></A>
Our economy has been buffeted by the global recession, and the roughest seas remain ahead.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050275"></A>
After tripling over the last eight years, business investment is expected to fall by 17% in 2009/10. The last echoes of the boom that have sustained the economy through most of this financial year are now fading.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050276"></A>
Apart from our agricultural sector, which has experienced the natural disaster and the natural wonder of flooding rains, our export outlook is challenging.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050277"></A>
By far the starkest numbers in our economic outlook are those on forecast unemployment. The economy continues to shed jobs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050278"></A>
While our unemployment rate remains half per cent better than the nation, unemployment is expected to rise, relentlessly and remorselessly ... as it has through this year, as it will through next year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050279"></A>
Unemployment for 2008-09 is expected to remain in line with the forecast at February’s Economic and Fiscal Update of 4% for the year, and is now forecast to be 6% in 2009/10.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050280"></A>
Unemployment is now expected to reach 7% the year after next, and is forecast to be at that rate through most of 2010/11. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050281"></A>
In starker, human terms that will see Queensland’s unemployment queue stretch to 175,000 people. That’s 175,000 individual tragedies ... with impacts that extend beyond the individual to their families, their children. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050282"></A>
It is our society that bears the human and financial cost, and we must fight against it.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050283"></A>
These are the 175,000 reasons why this Government does not resile from its commitment to funding a building program to generate demand and generate jobs--and build for the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050284"></A>
<Hansard-Bold>
Fiscal Outlook</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050285"></A>
At the centre of this Budget, and at the centre of the Queensland Government’s immediate economic strategy is a massive $18.2 billion capital works program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050286"></A>
The program will be maintained against the colossal drop in forecast revenue of more than $15 billion across the forward estimates. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050287"></A>
Our revenues from transfer duty, GST and royalties have all taken a battering.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050288"></A>
Royalty revenue, never forecast to stay at record highs, has been written down further as contracts have settled and the Australian dollar has appreciated. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050289"></A>
As private sector investment evaporates it is this public investment, undertaken in partnership with the Federal Government that will provide support to the economy.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050290"></A>
This is a deliberate strategy by the Government to support the economy and generate jobs. It is a deliberate strategy that recognises current economic circumstances.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050291"></A>
The budgeted injection of $18.2 billion--when the economy needs it most--necessarily means we need to make longer term decisions to provide stability to the State’s finances.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050292"></A>
Our capital program will need to adjust in the future to match the economic circumstances of the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050293"></A>
The Government is also adopting a deliberate strategy to return the budget to surplus.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050294"></A>
It is Labor in government that has delivered surplus budgets, Labor in government that has overseen our economy outperform the nation, Labor in government that has driven unemployment down and kept it below the national rate.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050295"></A>
With the revenue wipeout the Budget has been forced into deficit through the forward estimates.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050296"></A>
The 2008-09 estimated actual balance is a deficit of $574 million, which is almost $1 billion better than forecast in February. The Budget forecasts a negative operating balance of $1.954 billion for the year ahead, again around $1 billion better than that forecast in February.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050297"></A>
Mr Speaker,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050298"></A>
The 2009/10 Budget provides for $5.4 billion of measures that commence the turnaround of the State’s finances.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050299"></A>
The abolition of the fuel subsidy contributes $2.4 billion.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050300"></A>
While some measures will have immediate impact, others are about long-term structural reform that will deliver benefits beyond the forward estimates and for years to come.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050301"></A>
Under the new Financial Accountability Act of 2009 the Government is required to adopt a Charter of Fiscal Responsibility including the need to have Fiscal Principles.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050302"></A>
This Budget not only adopts these measures, it sets out the framework that will return the Budget to surplus into the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050303"></A>
Our 5-year Renewing Queensland Plan is central to our medium-term fiscal strategy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050304"></A>
The current and future balance sheet of the State will benefit from the proposed transactions. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050305"></A>
Under the plan, whole-of-state balance sheet debt will be reduced, and the net proceeds will be applied in the General Government sector to assist in the future funding of service delivery infrastructure.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050306"></A>
For the advancements in lifesaving medical treatments not yet imagined, for the educational technology not yet created and for the clean energy sources not yet developed, we need to look to the future and to move forward. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050307"></A>
We need to move forward, beyond those things Government currently does because it always has, to fund the priorities of the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050308"></A>
The plan is central to our commitment to stabilise the state’s balance sheet, and the government will move forward to legislate the plan with this Budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050309"></A>
As part of our resolve, we are adopting a commitment to contain future expenditure growth to real per capita levels. This is a fiscal discipline necessary to build the path back to balance and means expenditure growth beyond inflation and population growth will not be adopted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050310"></A>
The maintenance of a competitive tax regime is important in encouraging investment and in encouraging future growth and the Government reaffirms that commitment for the future.</Hansard-Body>

We affirm this commitment to maintain the lowest payroll tax rate in the nation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050312"></A>
We affirm this with our commitment to exclude apprentice and trainee wages from payroll tax, and extend a rebate of a further 25% on these wages. This measure will provide relief for the year ahead, and assist businesses to keep apprentices and trainees during the tough times ahead.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050313"></A>
I also announce further relief for business, with the extension of the terms for land tax payments for 2009-10 paving the way for the introduction of an instalment payments regime the following year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050314"></A>
We are committed to returning the Budget to surplus by 2015-16. This Budget begins the task of delivering on that commitment. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050315"></A>
It begins, but does not complete the task. This will be an ongoing quest.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050316"></A>
The Budget also includes other important structural reforms. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050317"></A>
An overhaul of local government subsidy programs will see future subsidies targeted at councils most in need. An additional $127 million is provided over the next two years to fund a program of significant works with a new capped scheme to be introduced from 1 July 2011.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050318"></A>
Our farsighted local government reforms were implemented to make councils stronger, and this reform aligns future funding with future need.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050319"></A>
As essential service providers, state governments around the nation expend half their entire budget on employee costs: on teachers and school cleaners, nurses and orderlies, police and court wardens and land titles clerks.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050320"></A>
$18.6 billion of the $39 billion allocated in this Budget is required for wages, superannuation and other costs of the workforce that serves Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050321"></A>
We are a Labor Government--a government that will honour the agreements it has with its employees. We will honour wage agreements, reached in good faith. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050322"></A>
We will also honour our commitment to lead by example in superannuation, because it is the right thing to do for the long term sustainability of our nation as we strive as a nation to fund secure retirement incomes for all Australians. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050323"></A>
We will honour those commitments provided in the past, but it must be recognised that the future landscape has changed. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050324"></A>
The Government will provide that for current year negotiations not agreed by 1 September, a new wages policy of 2.5% will apply--the mid-point of the Reserve Bank’s target band for inflation. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050325"></A>
The policy will be resolutely applied and effective on 1 July for all senior public servants. The wages freeze for Members of Parliament will continue.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050326"></A>
Visiting a renewed discipline upon Government is important in charting a course for budget sustainability.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050327"></A>
The 2008-09 Budget set a $60 million efficiency dividend, due to rise to $180 million for 2009-10. The Budget I present today sees the government bring forward a planned additional $100 million in targeted savings originally planned to commence from 2010-11.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050328"></A>
Total savings of $280 million form part of the 2009-10 Budget--to garner the benefits from our overhaul of the Public Service structure. The savings are set across the board and represent a bringing forward of our target for 2010-11.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050329"></A>
The reforms in this Budget set a course. It is a course that will require vigilance and further actions in the future. The reforms begin the task of returning the Budget to balance and improve our credit rating.</Hansard-Body>

$18.2 BILLION BUILDING PROGRAM</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050332"></A>
Our capital program is doing the heavy lifting on infrastructure investment. It alone is more than the combined total of the infrastructure spend planned by Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050333"></A>
The Budget proposes a building program that will support 127,000 jobs across Queensland.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050334"></A>
It is a building program that will create jobs, support demand and deliver the platform for future growth.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050335"></A>
The program’s breadth is aimed at the full force of the downturn delivered to us from the global recession.</Hansard-Body>

It’s an $18.2 billion program that continues, not cuts, our hospital building program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050338"></A>
Investment in hospitals and health facilities accounts for about $1.3 billion of capital works spend this year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050339"></A>
$155 million will be spent on the Gold Coast University Hospital as construction works will see it begin to take shape through the year, and an additional $80 million is allocated for a research facility to be built as part of the new Queensland Children’s Hospital.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050340"></A>
The development of the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, proposed in partnership with the private sector, will commence with more public beds provided sooner than originally planned.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050341"></A>
The new Mackay Hospital will begin to take shape this year with a spend of $61 million. We will move ahead on the upgrades of the Cairns and Mount Isa hospitals. The expansions of Townsville and Rockhampton hospitals are funded--and funded in partnership with a federal government that is finally putting money into building hospitals.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050342"></A>
Health capital works are underway across the state, including the expansions of Bundaberg Hospital and Robina Hospital, projects nearing completion at Ingham and Yeppoon hospitals and work will commence this year on the birthing centre at Toowoomba Hospital.</Hansard-Body>

<A ID="pgfId-1050344"></A>
Our massive program of transport infrastructure capital works will also continue. The expansion of the coal terminal at Abbot Point continues under our commitment to a business as usual approach with another $305 million in this Budget.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050345"></A>
The Cairns cruise terminal facility has $11 million allocated by this Budget, as we deliver on our commitment to the people of Cairns and the Tourism industry upon which they rely.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050346"></A>
The long awaited Port Access Road--which will benefit Townsville residents and their economy alike has $47.3 million allocated in 2009-10.</Hansard-Body>

<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050351"></A>
The $315 million new Houghton Highway Bridge goes $125 million further across the bay this year, and the second Gateway Bridge goes $259 million higher above the river this year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050352"></A>
Roadworks on the Roma-Taroom Road, on the Aramac-Torrens Creek Road and on the Carnarvon Highway will be completed and $4.4 million is allocated to the widening of the Flinders Highway west of Charters Towers.</Hansard-Body>

The realignment of the Dawson Highway at Calliope goes $36 million further and the widening of the Maryborough-Hervey Bay Road has $16 million allocated.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050354"></A>
Fittingly, the duplication of the Forgan Bridge in Mackay has $37 million allocated as part of our record building program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050355"></A>
Construction of the $466 million Eastern Busway from Buranda to Coorparoo and the $735 million Northern Busway will continue as we build the public transport infrastructure to sustain our growth.</Hansard-Body>

GENERATING JOBS IN HOUSING</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050364"></A>
Mr Speaker,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050365"></A>
The single largest injection into public housing in the state’s history will be funded in this Budget including a $140 million allocation from the Future Growth Fund to support the Australian Government’s stimulus package.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050366"></A>
This will add more than 4,000 to the housing stock in the State over the next three years. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050367"></A>
Boosts to the First Home Owner Grant and our nation-leading reforms abolishing stamp duty for first home buyers all the way to $500,000 have supported demand at the all important entry-level to the housing market.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050368"></A>
States like Victoria and South Australia have implemented sleight of hand temporary boosts to the First Home Owner Grant. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050369"></A>
These states still take more than they receive by whacking the first homeowner with tens of thousands of dollars in stamp duty.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050370"></A>
This Government has taken the lead--and we intend to stay there.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050371"></A>
Today I announce that we will continue on our quest to help young Queenslanders into their first homes. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050372"></A>
We will abolish stamp duty for vacant land for first home buyers who purchase land to build their first home up to $250,000. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050373"></A>
And we will extend the concession to land up to a value of $400,000--ensuring Queenslanders who chose to build their first home rather than buy will benefit.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050374"></A>
This move will bring the cost of our stamp duty abolitions for first home buyers to around $250 million in 2009-10.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050375"></A>
That’s $250 million that could be added back to the bottom line. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050376"></A>
But first home buyers today are the fastest growing proportion of the market--at around 30% of all home buyers--our reforms are directly aimed at stimulating the housing sector. And housing construction means jobs, apprenticeships and traineeships.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050377"></A>
Private dwelling investment was clubbed by the high interest rates of 2008 and the global recession has made sure that it has stayed on the canvas.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050378"></A>
Along with our continued quest to stimulate the market, we will oversee the $1.45 billion budgeted for construction and upgrades of social housing across the State.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050379"></A>
This unprecedented program will not only provide a roof over the heads of many of Queensland’s most needy, the work generated will help keep a roof over the heads of thousands of construction workers and their families.</Hansard-Body>

FRONTLINE SERVICES FOR A GROWING POPULATION</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050381"></A>
Mr Speaker </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050382"></A>
As we pause this year to celebrate our 150th year, the rush to join us continues.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050383"></A>
Data released this month confirmed that our population grew by more than 2,000 people per week on average over 2008.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050384"></A>
Our population continues to swell as the state’s warm embrace captures more hearts.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050385"></A>
These days we seek also to capture their minds. In fact, in the last decade, the number of researchers in Queensland has increased by 55%.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050386"></A>
It’s why we are investing in projects such as the Translational Research Institute at the Princess Alexandra Hospital. Our $100 million commitment, along with $140 million from the Australian Government will establish an Australian first--a one stop shop for the discovery, production and clinical testing of new biopharmaceuticals and treatments.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050387"></A>
Population growth means we need more frontline workers, not less. It means we need more teachers, more police, more ambulance officers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050388"></A>
This Budget does just that--it provides 350 more teachers and teacher aides, 203 more police and another 50 ambulance officers. It provides for 645 more doctors, nurses and health practitioners.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050389"></A>
Seven new schools over the next three years are to be built to cater for growth in expanding communities including on the Gold and Sunshine Coasts and in the booming western corridor.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050390"></A>
We will increase teacher aide hours and dedicate $20 million to improve literacy and numeracy, with 80 dedicated coaches, summer schools and more resources for those in danger of falling behind.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050391"></A>
A new Leadership Centre for school principals will be established, to provide our principals with the best chance to develop their skills and lift school performance.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050392"></A>
The 203 additional police funded in this year’s Budget will expand the ranks of a police force which has grown to 10,000 to serve our growing state.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050393"></A>
Only under Labor has our police to population ratio been brought to the national average and we intend to keep it there.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050394"></A>
New stations will be completed at Carseldine, Crestmead, Reedy Creek/Robina, Sippy Downs and Springfield and works will commence or progress on replacement stations at Murgon, Lockhart River, Camp Hill/Carina, Fortitude Valley and Charleville. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050395"></A>
As twenty ambulance stations will be constructed or redeveloped, so too will nine fire stations. 150 new ambulance vehicles, 23 new fire trucks and 34 rural fire service vehicles are also funded.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050396"></A>
Our rural fire service will gain more resources to improve safety as we honour our election commitment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050397"></A>
The government wants to ensure that appropriate resourcing of our rural fire service is in place and will commence a review of rural fire service funding and the fire levy system this year.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050398"></A>
We will also provide resources to some of our hardest working, and most important Queenslanders. Community sector workers who care and support some of our most vulnerable Queenslanders, the frail elderly, the disabled and the unwell, have recently had the value of their work recognised by the independent Queensland Industrial Relations Commission.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050399"></A>
The single biggest allocation of additional resources in this Budget--some $414 million across four years--is provided to support the community sector to continue their essential work.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050400"></A>
We will also assist older Queenslanders by increasing the subsidy available for electricity bills by 15.67% to assist with the increased cost of electricity. This increase is being funded by redirecting $6.7 million that was being paid to local governments to subsidise costs for street lighting.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050401"></A>
Tough times mean choices have to be made, and this Budget makes those choices.</Hansard-Body>

FUNDING SET ASIDE--FOR THE FUTURE</Hansard-Bold>
</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050403"></A>
Mr Speaker,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050404"></A>
In recent years the Government has established a number of important funds, and prudently set aside money for priorities.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050405"></A>
The Queensland Future Growth Fund was established with more than $3 billion and this Budget provides allocations not only to housing as outlined already, but to the development of clean coal technology vital to the future of our economy and our environment.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050406"></A>
The Future Growth Fund will maintain a balance in excess of $1 billion as at 30 June 2010 and continues to earn interest for the benefit of future allocations.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050407"></A>
The $50 million Renewable Energy Fund was established to support research and development for new forms of energy and today I announce a significant disbursement as we invest in the green energy solutions of the future:</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1050408"></A>
•	$9.3 million for a new Geothermal Power Station at Birdsville and for mapping potential geothermal sites closer to the coast;</Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1050409"></A>
•	$9 million for the Mackay Sugar Co-generation project; and,</Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1050410"></A>
•	$7.5 million for a project with the CSIRO, subject to gaining an industry partner, for SolarGas One the world’s first solar multi-tower array system using SolarGas technology.</Hansard-Body-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050411"></A>
Along with implementing our Solar Hot Water program, these initiatives are directed firmly at providing cleaner, greener ways to power our future development.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050412"></A>
The Climate Change Fund provides a funding stream of $30 million per annum to assist in meeting the other great challenge of our time--moving to a low carbon economy. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050413"></A>
Today I announce a range of initiatives that will form part of our future agenda on dealing with, and adapting to, the reality of climate change.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050414"></A>
We will build on the success of our ClimateSmart Home service with an allocation of $15 million over four years for the ClimateSmart Business Service.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050415"></A>
The new service will be developed this year to assist small-to-medium sized Queensland businesses to save energy and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the lead up to the planned introduction of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in 2011.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050416"></A>
We will also invest $8 million over four years to increase the energy efficiency of government buildings and set aside $15.6 million for assisting with preparedness for natural disasters made more likely by climate change.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050417"></A>
Last year I established a $70 million Prevention and Early Intervention Incentives Pool to drive innovative policy proposals aimed at preventing avoidable costs--human and financial.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050418"></A>
Simply put, we must seek out new interventions to prevent the tragic cycles which are so unimaginably costly to individuals, families, communities and their government.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050419"></A>
Today I announce a range of projects totalling $28.3 million over three years which will trial, test and evaluate new ideas, new modes of service delivery and new approaches to some age old problems.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050420"></A>
Community based housing for young people with a mental illness will seek to treat symptoms early before young people and their families are swept into a tragic spiral that can lead to a lifetime in and out of acute care at immense cost to the individual and to our health system.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050421"></A>
A pilot program to intervene early in new domestic violence cases will seek to avoid the confronting reality that episodes are rarely a one-off. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050422"></A>
Not only will families avoid the incalculable harm, we will also seek to avoid the other costs--call outs with further demands on social, health and emergency services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050423"></A>
Two separate programs will seek to avoid the costs of the cycle of recidivism. Offenders with cognitive or developmental disorders who otherwise will likely cycle through the justice system regularly at immense cost, and without benefit, will be targeted along with juvenile offenders at risk of homelessness and a likely life of offending. Securing jobs for these young offenders will be the frontline task.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050424"></A>
The largest allocation is for a $8.7 million program in the Logan area to improve literacy and numeracy outcomes at low socio-economic schools through new and innovative approaches including supporting parents to improve their parenting skills and literacy and numeracy skills to help break the typical cycle.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050425"></A>
Other projects seek to trial new ways of avoiding ongoing costs in the ambulance and health systems, in child protection and in disability services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050426"></A>
Not all will get the results we might hope. But through these pilots and these trials we seek not only to avoid the human costs of violence, neglect and lack of support but to avoid the inevitable cost to the public of dealing with the consequences.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050427"></A>
If we can prevent and avoid these costs--human and financial--we will do a great service to many individuals and families but also to the community that otherwise bears the costs of social intervention services.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050428"></A>
The demands on government services have substantially increased over the last two decades in particular. This funding is about providing sustainable services for the future, not just picking up the pieces afterwards, and the bill.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050429"></A>
These funds--the Future Growth Fund and the Renewable Energy Fund, the Climate Change Fund and the Prevention and Early Intervention Incentives Pool--make possible these investments at a time of fiscal rectitude.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050430"></A>
By setting aside these funds for the future we have provided ourselves with the opportunity to fund initiatives to deal with the challenges of our future: environmentally, socially and economically. </Hansard-Body>

Mr Speaker,</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050434"></A>
The framework set down by this Budget and the bills I introduce today are the most significant structural reforms to the state’s finances since the Second World War.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050435"></A>
Together the bills seek to address the ravages of a global recession not seen since the Great Depression.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050436"></A>
This is a budget that reinforces our determination to build Queensland’s future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050437"></A>
...our determination to build Queensland, to build the roads, the schools, the hospitals that our growing state needs.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050438"></A>
...our determination to create jobs for Queenslanders with our record building program.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050439"></A>
...our determination to keep pace with the essential services needed by a young and growing state with more nurses, more police, more teachers and more frontline workers.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050440"></A>
...our determination to apply fiscal discipline and make the tough decisions to put the state’s finances on the pathway to surplus.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050441"></A>
...our determination to keep our eye firmly on the future as we deal with the immediate challenges </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050442"></A>
This Budget lays the foundation stones for the path that lies ahead.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050443"></A>
Paved with uncertainty, we should--indeed we must--be optimistic about the fundamental strengths of the ground on which we build.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050444"></A>
We are building here for the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050445"></A>
We are building now for the future.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050446"></A>
Building upon our strengths.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050447"></A>
For a time ahead, beyond the current hour, when the path is clearer and our bright future is forever the destination ahead.</Hansard-Body>

Queensland’s fiscal position has been adversely impacted by the global financial crisis, resulting in a substantial deficit. This deficit position, along with the call on Queensland’s balance sheet from our building program, have put the state’s finances under pressure. Corrective action is required to put the state’s balance sheet on a more sustainable footing. </Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body>
<A ID="pgfId-1050569"></A>
Given the present economic climate, the Queensland government has committed to protecting jobs and continuing with a strong infrastructure program in an effort to maintain employment opportunities and to provide the basis for future growth and job creation. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>
Hansard</Hansard-Italic>

<A ID="pgfId-1050570"></A>
Leave granted.</Hansard-Body>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050571"></A>
However, there are limits to what the State Government alone can do. The State cannot afford to continue to be the principal provider of both commercial infrastructure and public and social infrastructure.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050572"></A>
Choices must be made. The Government has chosen to preserve the capital program to support the economy. The Government has chosen to improve the State’s balance sheet with our far sighted plan to restructure our holdings and position the State to meet future demands. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050573"></A>
The 2009-10 State Budget is focused on supporting the continued delivery of key public infrastructure--schools, hospitals, public transport--and the delivery of public services through these facilities.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050574"></A>
In this context, a staged program of asset sales over coming years will play an important role in funding the infrastructure program, reducing State debt and encouraging private sector provision of infrastructure.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050575"></A>
The sale of a number of State assets is designed to realise value, reduce risk and/or obviate the need to further fund the significant ongoing capital requirements of these businesses, where the private sector can fund those requirements and, in particular, build Queensland’s export capacity.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050576"></A>
Among other factors, the staging of the proposed asset sales will be influenced by the timing of the recovery in financial markets which may take 12 months or longer. However, a significant program of asset sales is able to be progressed over the next three to five years, with assets being brought to market at the appropriate time.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050577"></A>
The proposed infrastructure assets restructure and sale program involves the following:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1050578"></A>
•	the sale of Forestry Plantations Queensland’s (FPQ) business/assets;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1050579"></A>
•	the sale of Queensland Motorways Limited’s (QML) business/assets, including the planned Port of Brisbane Motorway upgrade project;</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1050580"></A>
•	the sale of the Port of Brisbane Corporation’s (POBC) business/assets, but not including the Port of Bundaberg; and</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1050581"></A>
•	the sale of Queensland Rail’s (QR) above and below rail coal businesses/assets, along with Ports Corporation of Queensland’s (PCQ) Abbot Point Coal Terminal.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050582"></A>
It is intended that the passenger services business and associated suburban rail network will remain in State ownership. The Bill provides for other assets of QR to be subject to the Bill to facilitate the split out and sale of the coal business. As the government has previously committed, we will investigate the other components of QR’s business for possible inclusion where feasible. We will consult with QR and its employees and their representatives throughout this process.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050583"></A>
The sales program will comprise the sale of FPQ, POBC and QML’s assets and will likely be completed in around two to three years. It is anticipated that FPQ and POBC will be sold first, subject to the conditions of the financial markets.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050584"></A>
Also, the sales program will comprise QR’s above and below rail coal assets, along with PCQ’s Abbot Point Coal Terminal, and QR’s other commercial rail services. The restructure and sale of these assets is expected to occur within three to five years.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050585"></A>
In relation to employees of the enterprises involved in the asset sales, the government is committed to a fair process which will involve them and their representatives. As has been the case in the past with asset sales, all employees in affected government owned corporations will have the terms and conditions of their current enterprise bargaining agreement honoured for the life of that agreement. As well, employment guarantees for award employees will be put in place for two years beyond the date of sale. Employees transferring to the new businesses will experience no interruption to their continuity of service or accrued entitlements. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050586"></A>
The government has moved to establish working parties with trade unions to discuss the detail of transition arrangements and to represent the interests of employees in this process. In terms of employment, the objective of the government is to protect jobs and create viable growing enterprises with the prospect of growth and increasing jobs.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050587"></A>
These asset sales could be expected to deliver proceeds in excess of $15 billion, with all proceeds to be directed to the reduction of State debt, plus an estimated additional $12 billion in avoided future capital expenditure over the next five years.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050588"></A>
In order to facilitate the immediate commencement of the appropriate governance and other arrangements required to support the proposed restructure and sale program, special sale legislation needs to be enacted.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050589"></A>
The proposed Bill, the Infrastructure Investment (Asset Restructuring and Disposal) Bill 2009, contains similar generic provisions to those used in other asset sale processes undertaken by the State in recent years. The bill is consistent with the approach adopted in the energy asset sales and the sale of wind farms and the Enertrade gas businesses under the Energy Assets (Restructuring and Disposal) Act 2006 (EARDA) and the sales of the Cairns and Mackay airports and the Port of Brisbane Corporation’s interest in the Brisbane Airport through the Airport Assets (Restructuring and Disposal Act) 2008 (AARDA). It shares many parallels with the SEQ Water Restructure. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050590"></A>
The proposed Bill is required to facilitate the full implementation of the Government’s program of restructuring and divestment within 5 years. The Bill empowers the responsible Minister to facilitate the restructure of the businesses, assets and liabilities of the Government owned entities by the use of powers including the ability to issue transfer notices and project directions. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050591"></A>
The Bill also adopts other provisions of the EARDA and AARDA to facilitate due diligence and sale processes, which affect third parties’ commercial rights, such as excluding judicial review or obtaining the consent of third parties to the release of confidential information or to the transfer of contracts for the purposes of the restructuring. Given the State’s need for certainty, delays could adversely affect the sale process and the interests of taxpayers. This is a significant commercial program and the purchasers of the relevant sale entities and their stakeholders require certainty. The provisions are particularly necessary to avoid the State suffering a significant financial detriment if the divestments were delayed by legal proceedings by persons or corporations seeking to obstruct the sale processes for commercial reasons or otherwise.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050592"></A>
In addition, given the very high levels of commercial sensitivity and probity which must be maintained for the restructuring and sales program, it is considered necessary to provide certain exemptions for the project from the operation of the Right to Information Act 2009 which has not yet commenced. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050593"></A>
The Government has a successful history of asset sales. As recently as last year (with the final transaction completing early this year), the Government conducted a process for the sale of Government Owned Corporation owned Cairns and Mackay airports and shareholding in the Brisbane International airport. This successful process generated total contracted proceeds of $1.028 billion and follows previous successful divestments of other Government Owned Corporation businesses. Each of these transactions provided a valuable return for the taxpayer. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050594"></A>
It is anticipated that the foreshadowed carefully targeted asset sales will be a major reform to commercial infrastructure provision in Queensland. They have a focus on facilitating future export growth through coordinated port and rail coal chain infrastructure ownership and future expansion and the further development of the Port of Brisbane.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As the budget just presented makes clear, in this time of global economic downturn there is a need to preserve our revenues while at the same time take measures to maintain or stimulate employment. This bill contains measures which reduce government expenditure, increase revenues and provide incentives to encourage employment. The Fuel Subsidy Repeal and Revenue and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 implements these measures by repealing the Fuel Subsidy Act 1997 and amending the Duties Act 2001, the First Home Owner Grant Act 2000, the Land Tax Act 1915 and the Pay-roll Tax Act 1971, along with making possible the casino tax rate changes which were announced in the 2008-09 major economic statement. Amendments are also being made to the Statistical Returns Act 1896. I seek leave to have the remainder of my speech incorporated in <Hansard-Italic>

<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050611"></A>
Since it was established in 1997 following a High Court decision, the Queensland Fuel Subsidy Scheme has been the subject of two major reviews focused on ensuring that Queensland motorists obtain the full benefit of the subsidy. In 2000, the payment of the retail subsidy was moved from wholesalers to fuel retailers to address concerns with the wholesale model. Changes were also made to the bulk end user scheme. More recently, the Queensland Fuel Subsidy Commission of Inquiry investigated the extent of passing on of the subsidy to Queensland motorists and considered options for improving the effective operation of the Scheme. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050612"></A>
The Inquiry recommended that the Scheme be abolished if a way could not be found to ensure the subsidy was being passed on. None of the submissions to the Inquiry or during the subsequent public consultation process undertaken on the gross price model identified workable options for improvement. Also, it was clear from expert evidence given to the Inquiry that there is no perfect system to ensure that the subsidy is fully passed on. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050613"></A>
In 2001-02, the subsidy cost $451.9 million. By 2007-08, this had increased to $558.9 million and the cost is expected to reach $560 million this year. It is forecast to cost $636 million in 2012-13. The State’s fiscal position makes the retention of the Fuel Subsidy Scheme unsustainable. The Government would be required to borrow to continue to fund it. To borrow for this purpose would run counter to the principle of intergenerational equity, as future generations would be required to fund the services consumed today. The Government intends to abolish the Scheme. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050614"></A>
This Bill repeals the Fuel Subsidy Act 1997 so that subsidy entitlement will cease to apply to retail fuel sold, or bulk end user fuel used, on or after 1 July 2009. To ensure that the Scheme is wound up in a timely manner, all subsidy claims will be required to be lodged with the Office of State Revenue by 30 September 2009. The Bill also makes a number of amendments relating to matters relevant to the winding up process, including ensuring no provisional subsidy is paid to retailers for July, and clarifying when fuel is used as bulk end user fuel and when diesel is used for an off-road purpose. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050615"></A>
Mr Speaker, the Government recognises that Queensland motorists will all feel the impact of these changes and does not want to diminish in any way the burden this may place on them. However, abolition of the Fuel Subsidy Scheme is part of the Government’s plan to regain our AAA credit rating and restore the Budget surplus and ensure we can continue to invest in important areas such as running our schools, hospitals, police and other vital front-line services.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050616"></A>
As announced in the Major Economic Statement in December 2008, the Land Tax Act 1915 will be amended to impose a 0.5 per cent surcharge on that part of the aggregate value of a taxpayer’s land exceeding $5 million. This will apply for the 2009-10 and later financial years. The land tax surcharge will apply to less than 4% of land taxpayers and is estimated to provide an additional $93 million in revenue in 2009-10. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050617"></A>
A number of revenue measures in the Bill will assist taxpayers and stimulate employment. Amendments to the Duties Act 2001 will extend the existing transfer duty concession for first home buyers who purchase vacant land with the intention of constructing a home. The amount to which the full concession applies will increase from $150,000 to $250,000 while the amount at which the concession phases out will increase from $300,000 to $400,000. First home buyers purchasing vacant land for $250,000 will now pay no duty compared with $5,675 duty under the existing concession. Without the concession, transfer duty would be $7,175. These changes will apply to contracts entered into on or after 1 July 2009.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050618"></A>
Members will be aware that the Commonwealth introduced a First Home Owner Boost on 14 October 2008 to stimulate the housing market by providing an additional grant of $7,000 for existing homes and $14,000 for newly constructed homes. The Boost was on top of the grant of $7,000 paid by the Queensland Government. In the six months following the introduction of the Boost, the number of Queensland first home owner grant payments increased by 77% compared with the previous six months. The biggest increase was for new homes where payments rose by 115%. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050619"></A>
Originally, the Boost was to end on 30 June 2009. However, the recent Commonwealth Budget announced the extension of the Boost until 31 December 2009. The First Home Owner Grant Act 2000 is therefore amended by this Bill to reflect this extension. Consistent with the Commonwealth’s announcement, the amount of the Boost will be halved after 30 September 2009 to $3,500 for an established home and $7,000 for a new home.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050620"></A>
In the 2008-09 Budget I announced the First Home Owner Grant would not be available for first homes worth $1 million or more. Commencement of the cap was deferred until 1 July 2009 at the request of the Commonwealth as part of the arrangements for the First Home Owner Boost. With the Boost now being extended until 31 December 2009, it is necessary again to amend the First Home Owner Grant Act 2000 to defer commencement of the cap until 1 January 2010. This is an amendment that is required by the Commonwealth Government.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The Pay-roll Tax Act 1971 is to be amended to provide employers who employ apprentices and trainees with a rebate of tax for the 2009-10 financial year. Wages paid to apprentices and trainees are already exempt from pay-roll tax. An employer who employs apprentices or trainees whose wages are exempt from pay-roll tax will now also be able to claim a 25% rebate of pay-roll tax in relation to those wages. The rebate will reduce pay-roll tax payable on the wages of other employees of the employer. The rebate will apply for the 2009-10 year. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050622"></A>
Mr Speaker, this additional assistance to employers complements Queensland’s highly competitive pay-roll tax rate of 4.75% and a competitive threshold of $1 million. It will assist employers to provide job certainty during the current economic downturn and help them to build and maintain a skilled workforce for the future.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050623"></A>
Queensland continues to provide a competitive tax environment. Per capita, Queensland state tax is estimated at $2,087 in 2009-10, compared to an average of $2,487 for the other states and territories. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

Mr Speaker the Bill will also make possible the casino tax rate changes which were announced in the 2008-09 Major Economic Statement. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

The State will receive an additional $36 million in revenue for 2009-10 as a direct result of these changes. Gaming machine gross revenue in casinos has traditionally been taxed at lower rates compared to gaming machine gross revenue in clubs and hotels. These changes will reduce the disparity between the tax rates applicable to gaming machines in casinos and those applicable to large clubs and hotels.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

At present, casino taxes are levied as follows:</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1050627"></A>
•	Conrad Jupiters and Conrad Treasury--20 per cent of gaming win (ie the net of player bets and payouts) on all activities except premium junket play, where a 10 per cent rate applies.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>

•	Conrad Jupiters and Conrad Treasury--20 per cent of gaming win (ie the net of player bets and payouts) on all activities except gaming machines (where a 30 per cent rate will apply) and premium junket play, where a 10 per cent rate will continue to apply. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<A ID="pgfId-1050631"></A>
•	Jupiters Townsville Hotel and Casino and The Reef Hotel Casino--10 per cent of gaming win on all activities except gaming machines (where a 20 per cent rate will apply) and premium junket play, where a 10 per cent rate will now apply. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font-Hanging-Indent1>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050632"></A>
Amendments will also be made to remove the requirement for the casinos to pay a separate Community Benefit Levy of 1 per cent of casino gross and premium junket revenue. The levy will be incorporated into the increased overall tax take and indexed to ensure growth in future funds available to the casino benefit funds.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
<A ID="pgfId-1050633"></A>
The Levy is currently used to fund the Casino Community Benefit Fund which supports local community groups. To ensure community groups are still able to access this valuable source of funding, the Casino Community Benefit Fund (which consists of the Breakwater Casino Community Benefit Fund, Cairns Casino Community Benefit Fund, and the Jupiters Casino Community Benefit Fund) will continue but will instead be funded directly from within the Community Investment Fund rather than the Levy. </Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

As with the other gambling taxes, an amount of 8.5% will be paid from the total casino tax collections to the Community Investment Fund.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>

In addition to the revenue legislation amendments, the Bill also amends the Statistical Returns Act 1896. The purpose of the amendment is to modernise and improve the efficiency of the Statistical Returns Act to ensure the sustainable collection of official statistics for informed planning, decision making, policy development, service delivery, resource allocation and evaluation in the Queensland Government.</Hansard-Body-Small-Font>
